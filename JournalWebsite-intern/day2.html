                <h2>TAG Project Updates</h2>
                <p>This morning, arriving at TAG, I met with Ben, who I had previously worked with on assets for real estate clients including Hali, Adamson, M3, and Hall & Hart. Specifically, creating After Effects renders for their clients' properties.</p>
                
                <p>There had been news that one of M3's properties had sold, and therefore they needed to change the ad copy on the posts to advertise the successful sale. I created two versions of the motion graphic in both square and vertical format.</p>
                
                <p>Over the last month, as I knew I would be working within After Effects, I have been taking a course by Australian YouTuber Ben Marriott. Throughout this series of tutorials, I learned about folder hierarchies and the importance of maintaining different precompositions that can be pieced together in final render comp files for the different ratios a client may need. This ensures that if there are future points of feedback, there is only one set of changes that needs to be made.</p>
                
                <p>I discovered today, while accessing files I had worked on previously, there was a lack of organisation throughout the workspace, and the two ratios had completely different main sequences and subsequences for each aspect ratio. However, I managed to find a workaround where I manually separated the different pre-comp layers and successfully merged the file so that I didn't have to double my workload.</p>
                
                <p>Below I have uploaded my animation as a animated GIF however the deliverable was a high resolution video in different aspect ratios.</p>

                <h2>Hali Project</h2>
                <p>After this initial task I began working on another motion graphics Asset for another client Hali.</p>
                
                <p>With this project, i had been supplied a rough idea from the client that they wanted to highlight. "live here, swim here". Making use of an aerial photo of the area. I got a little creative with this, made use of some animation techniques I had been picking up from the online course I had been taking, included vector and path animation.</p>

                <h2>Moose Toys Project Process</h2>
                <p>Yesterday, on my day off, I headed to the city to meet with a friend for lunch. Afterward, I went to Big W to check out if there were any relevant toys for me to experiment with developing into an Augmented Reality filter.</p>
                
                <p>I found the Moose Toy brand there with their different licensed brands: Mr. Beast and Bluey. I bought one of the Bluey sets as I thought it would be good to experiment with and create an example/mockup to take to the meeting in a few weeks.</p>
                
                <p>I presented this work in progress, explained the lengthy process necessary for 3D modeling, retopology, texturing, etc., and discussed my reasoning behind choosing these toys instead of a different off-brand toy or other product. Namely because using official products avoids questions about whether the work was created for a different client that had signed on.</p>
                
                <p>I also made a very short sketch to illustrate what I plan on animating.</p>
