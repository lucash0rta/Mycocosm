            <p>This week I finalised the project pitch for the AR project for moose toys, working on the final iterations and hosting for the slide decks example.</p>
            
            <p>The plan is to go in with a flash deck and with a working prototype.</p>
            
            <p>I will attach the finalised slides that I worked on. The meeting ended up being on thursday the 23rd.</p>
            
            <p>I spoke with Zoe in regards to continuing on after the internship and she mentioned that potentially there could be a place for me in a couple of weeks while we were on our way to the meeting.</p>
            
            <p>I will attach some of the slides in a GIF format below however these should not be shared beyond this Journal.</p>

            <p>I sat in a room with the global marketing director at Moose toys and the head of the children's toys department and after being given a briefing of the potential project I was then given an opportunity to discuss the research and example I had been working on. Discussing and awnsweering questions from the moose Toys team was exciting. We had aligned in the form of a platform agnostic open source web based augmented reality approach which suited the various needs of the product at hand and the Moose companies wants for the future of the product.</p>
            
            <p>There were a lot of interpersonal takeaways from this experience. Beforehand i made sure my shirt had no wrinkles, I polished my shoes etc and looked sharp. I delivered with confidence but not overly wordy or technical I received positive feedback from my managers who seemed pleasantly surprised by my people skills and ability to stay natural under pressure.</p>
            
            <p>Then on the following friday I worked on some other Real estate client edits like alot of my previous work. I also calculated out my hours that I had worked this far in the internship and after checking with WIL at RMIT I realised I had only up until the 10th of February until my internship would be completed. I mentioned this to my internship supervisor / mentor / TAG design lead; Sophie. We sat down and had a chat about my future at TAG and she told me to do some research into what pay rate I think would be suitable moving forward.</p>
            
            <p>This edit I believe is one of my stronger real estate ads to date and you may not spot it but I leveraged AI to turn the clients previs rneders into moving images in the third and fourth shot, breathing life into what would just be a zooming image, adding just a touch of depth and movement to what wouldve been an only still image / animation driven edit.</p>
