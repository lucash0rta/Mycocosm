            <p>This week has been my final week at TAG as an intern. There has been some confusion as it has not been entirely clear as to we did not sit down to discuss the final terms of what coming on to work would Tag will look like. I had been hoping to come on as a full time designer however after discussions and some negotiation it is clear that they would prefer to bring me on as a casual freelance employee for the time being. I have a contract with a set amount of time for the Butterbaby AR project and have laid out all deliverables that will need to be met within this timeframe. Additionally I worked on bringing my previous UI flow for the planned AR filter to life for a presentation.</p>
            
            <p>The team were so excited to see the butter baby alive and animated. I leveraged AI to do this in conjunction with after effects motion graphics, supplied pre-vis renders and some extra tricks I have up my sleeve.</p>
            
            <p>I will attach a GIF below of the final presentation that was in a high quality video resolution. However this is not to be shared as it is under an NDA ü§êü§´</p>

            <p>Additionally I made a short cinema 4d animation to be included in a slide deck for a pitch, gave my presentation to the butter baby team and worked on various pieces of research for current clients of tag's feasibility for leveraging 3d animation and AR / VR and web based 3d interactions for future projects.</p>
