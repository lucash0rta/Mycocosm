            <p>Due to some miscommunication between myself and the university prior I had been doing some work, volunteering my time with TAG however officially as the documentation surrounding the Work Integrated Learning Scheme had not been approved by the university at that time I cannot count it towards my interned hours as apart of the course.</p>
            
            <p>I am technically beginning my internship journal and time reporting from today.</p>
            
            <p>This morning as I arrived we had a huddle and discussed what we had all done over the break, sharing a highlight for the christmas period.</p>
            
            <p>After this I spoke with Ben who account manages for some of the real estate projects that I had been conducting some volunteered work towards. There was some additional feedback on some posts set to launch during the break that need changing however this work was not urgent.</p>
            
            <p>I spoke with one of the account managers; Andy. Who forwarded me some information in regards to a potential client called "Moose Toys". They had reached out to Tag equiring to explore AR for an in-store brand/product activation. I have been tasked with putting together a slide deck and conducting research into this field as I have expressed this is where some previous expertise in my personal work lays.</p>
            
            <p>As a part of this research I looked into all the available AR platforms at the time and put together some notable talking points for the available platforms as reasoning as to why we should go ahead and utilise the Meta Spark AR platform for this project.</p>

            <p>In addition to this i quickly put together a brief test of the spark ar platform making use of models sourced online and quick mixamo animations to show to Andy some very brief possibilities of outcomes.</p>
