            <h3>Monday</h3>
            <p>This week I started off by diving back into the creative work for Hall & Hart (H&H). I attempted to create a parallax effect in 3D space using After Effects, starting with the photo of a house and sidewalk. I tried cutting out various layers to get the desired effect, but the final execution didn't turn out as expected. The issue arose from the clean lines and cuts in the photo, especially on the sidewalk.</p>

            <p>Later, I moved on to completing the Adamson edits. After finishing the edits, I uploaded them to Google Drive and unassigned myself from the task, assigning Ben to take over.</p>
            
            <p>The edits were my first time really receiving direct feedback from the client.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout the process of working on the adamson video I experimented with some AI upscaling, to take the 1080p video from the client and to expand it, allowing more creative range to design the layout of the planned shots from the supplied videos.</p>

            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
            <p>In the morning, I continued working on the Hall & Hart project, focusing on improving the 3D aspect. I revisited the Marigold depth estimation for the Hall & Hart 3D print, but unfortunately, it didn't work out. The result was unusable for the animation work in After Effects.</p>

            <p>I then explored SORA-3D on Hugging Face, which seemed promising for generating 3D models. The tool might allow me to generate more accurate models that could better reflect the original photo.</p>

            <p>Later in the day, I had a meeting with Sophie to check in on my progress. During our discussion, I mentioned the possibility of adding some 3D work to the Hall & Hart videos, especially focusing on their workflow. We also discussed the possibility of me being put onto Webflow work. Sophie suggested that I check out Webflow University to get up to speed with the platform.</p>
            
            <h3>Friday</h3>
            <p>Today, my main focus was continuing work on the Hall & Hart ticket. I explored the final photos of the Casa Willoughby project, available on the H&H website. The visuals are stunning, and I've decided to use the video asset hosted on Vimeo, downloading it in a lossless quality for the project. The Vimeo URL, which is embedded on the H&H site, uses the video as a background with no player controls, which is an interesting feature I haven't seen before.</p>

            <p>I also began work on another carousel slide for the website.</p>
