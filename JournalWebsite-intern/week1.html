            <p>This week was my first week at TAG. I met people in the office, discussed the work that will be done throughout my internship and addressed areas of interest of mine personally for the type of work I'd like to do with discussions with my mentor Sophie.</p>
            
            <h3>Day 1</h3>
            <p>I arrived at the office early and met with Sophie, who is helping me get settled into the TAG workplace and giving me a tour. In the morning, I was tasked with editing a longer video commissioned by a client within TAG from a different studio. The project was a commercial real estate video, showcasing the lifestyle of the surrounding suburb. I created two versions of the video and exported them for social media in square and portrait formats.</p>

            <p>I was tasked with creating some social media posts for tag using motion graphics to then be posted on their socials; showcasing recent work they had done designing websites for clients. I began working on the video for their client Hall&Hart.</p>
            
            <p>Making use of my skills in after effects to create a clean animation. I iterated on this via feedback and showed the team the final product as the day was wrapping up.</p>

            <h2 data-heading="Slack and Clickup">Slack and Clickup</h2>
            <p>I was added to the companies slack and Clickup..<br>
            Slack is a communication tool similar to discord with various chats inside the one server, with different rooms and roles for users. Used for working on the projects in house and for communication outside of work hours, between colleagues and on WFH days.</p>
            
            <p>Clickup however is used for tasking people certain roles or jobs to do, providing a space to track projects.</p>
