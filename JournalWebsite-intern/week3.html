            <p>Monday, Arriving at the office, over the weekend I had decided to do some basic motion graphics tests for a company that an account manager Andy had setup a meeting with. This potential account is for a web publishing and ad hosting service based in sydney called publift.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically their system fuse for ad placements and revenue distribution.</p>

            <p>I mentioned i had done a simple test, showed it to andy and he sent it off to the client to show them as just some early tests, The potential fit was to be for a charachter based motion graphics piece stepping through their product and the various aspects / features.</p>
