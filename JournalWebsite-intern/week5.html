            <p>This week I locked in on creating a pitch deck for the potential client moose toys which we now had a date set, we are to have a meeting on the 23rd of January in regards to the potential AR Project.</p>
            
            <p>I continued working on the bluey example as on of their main toy lines is this, we do not know what the potential brand of toys will be that we will work on. My main tasks for this week were this project and solidifying a process across web development, coding out the platform and then preparing a slide deck to showcase my research.</p>

            <p>Some key steps,<br>
            Modelling the charachter from 3d scanned refernce</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Rigging and weight painting said charachter. with a custom setup to show the animation</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Paying attention to the single rig structure that is applicable to web based gltf format 3d assets and animations to ensure it can be hosted and work properly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ai generating a small puddle and fish for the charachter to be fishing / catching within the simple web based animation.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Adittionally I had another task for a client HALI - another real estate project, creating a carousel post and some video animations. The client requested some music be added to the posts and therefor I used Suno AI to geneate some unliscened generic, beachy music and added some additional flare in ableton. Bit of reverb and some waves crashing.</p>

            <p>I also collected reference assets for feasibility for creating a similar augmented reality project for a client called ButterBaby an american startup cookie company with select stores in indonesia opening soon.</p>
