<div><h1></h1><p dir="auto">Arrving at Tag today we had a stand up; this is how we start each monday; although today was a little bit different, we were to say out loud the usual main things we had to do this week but on top of that today we also  said any career goals for the year. I had written down some ideas of what to say; establishing myself in a career where i can blend my varied technical expertise through an actionable design framework for making interesting and attention grabbing design work for clients etc. However when it got to me i felt as though I fumbled and just mentioned that seeing as this year is my first year in uni i would like to establish myself. </p>
<p dir="auto">I didn't quite make complete sense but I froze up a bit / got anxious. I suppose that's one thing I would like to work on this year. Working well under pressure in public scenarios and being quick on my feet. </p>
<p dir="auto">Beginning the day I had some revisions for an Animation I had been working on last week and decided to make some improvements that i thought were necessary. </p>
<p dir="auto">Below are the final animations that have been sent to the client an initial feedback round. </p>

<p dir="auto">I had also been meaning to finish a carousel post for the same company however, felt confused and a bit uninspired.  This company does not have a design brief  document and have conflicting styles across their online presence. Despite this, i kept working with the assets; both modern and  hand drawn styles that had been provided although still feel dissatisfied with the results. </p>
