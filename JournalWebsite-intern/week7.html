            <p>This week I began working on a pitch for ButterBaby, visualising the aspects of AR. Initially i was meant to put together a plan. As I began staging out the various UI Elements its started to really come together. I made sure to use figma for this step of prototyping, it is not my favourite but as it is used frequently in house I thought it would be a good opportunity to sharpen my skills.</p>

            <p>Additionally I worked on some real estate renders for a commercial and storage development titled Found based here in Melbourne. I leveraged alot of the skills I've been picking up while learning after effects and believe these are some of my better edits. Mainly because of having a strong workflow, being able to quickly organise the files and precomps in a way where I can export to a variety of formats for various social media post sizes and platforms quickly.</p>

            <p>I also leveraged AI video tools and after effects to create a looping textural video to use in a NALA email campaign that Sophie was working on</p>
