  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>September 16th - 21st</p>
  <p>This week, I made significant progress on the physical elements of my final project. I experimented with various mediums, including painting, and created a laser-cut object featuring a forced perspective illusion in the Trompe L'Oeil style. Additionally, I connected a crystal LCD display to an Arduino, successfully running looping text on it. My research into Raspberry Pi hardware for driving displays within my project continued, alongside my ongoing experiments with AI.</p>
  <p>On Sunday, just before the milestone presentation on Monday, I worked on a Unity environment, several 3D objects, and incorporated stage design and my original TikTok videos into one TikTok video, making use of these various mediums and the images/meanings of the mediums as language within the work.</p>
  
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <h3>Rasberry pi media player for sculptural pieces -</h3>
  <p>While researching robotics and display drivers, I found an article about running multiple Raspberry Pi units connected to a base server for synchronized video content deployment. Surprisingly, it's located in the Melbourne art book library where I recently visited an exhibition.</p>
  <p>The creators use Raspberry Pi 3's, which I hadn't considered for media playback. The price comparison is eye-opening:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pi 4b: $100</li>
    <li>Pi 5: $120</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+: $40</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I was about to buy a Pi 5, but now I could get 2-3 Pi 3 models instead. This setup could work for multi-screen media playback, and I might learn to synchronize video outputs through tutorials.</p>
  <p>The article is on Core Electronics' website. They also offer ESP32 chips as Arduino alternatives, and Arduinos for $10.

  <h4>Continued Reading of Vilem Flusser Communicology.</h4>
  <p>"No wonder we still tend to use technical images for retelling stories told by linear texts instead of trying to find out what else may be done with them. And when we do try to find out, we believe we are doing research, or experimental art, instead of being aware of the fact that we are spelling."</p>
  <p>This excerpt from the text stuck out to me. It is difficult to detach not just from the predetermined aesthetics of so-called experimental art, but also from the notion that anything existing outside of colloquial language and forms is predetermined as experimental simply because it sits outside this norm. It sets the work apart, yet the work remains within the system. Therefore, the new language we attempt to grasp, as Vilem Flusser describes through the technical imagination, should be one that operates within the socio-economic world of established models and platforms.</p>
  <p>This is something I aim for: to use the language of the image in composing the work, incorporating the materials, form, and stylistic decisions of platforms as the method. The goal is to create a more pop-oriented work, much like how Andy Warhol subverted meaning through mechanical reproduction.</p>
  <p>Ongoing reading of the Stack by Benjamin Bratton and Simulacra and Simulations aswell</p>
