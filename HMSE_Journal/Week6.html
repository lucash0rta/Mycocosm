        <h1>Week 6 Reflections</h1>
        
        <p>This past week I have made fast progress and have taken on advice from class to just start creating. I explored some various forms and ideas in a digital sculpting software I use called Zbrush, attended various lectures/artist talks outside of class that expanded my personal views and understanding of art practice and came up with ideas for how to best present the work.</p>
        
        <p>I continued reading "the stack" by benjamin Bratton; which has been supplying me with a visual understanding of the platforms and socioeconomic systems prevalent today, how they are grounded in history and how this can be visualised. I also made great progress on Simulacra and Simulation by Jean Beaudrillard</p>
        
        <p>I also attended Soft Centre which was eye opening, a mixture of various live performances that affected me; the most enjoyable being that of which I had developed an understanding through the discourse day where some artists spoke to their works and research. This evoked a hightened multisensory feeling feeling which interwove ideological and research practices that I'm very much interested in.</p>
        
        <h2>Research</h2>
        
        <h3>Simulacra and simulations - Jean Beaudrillard</h3>
        
        <p>This week as I have been continuing to read Simulacra and simulations.</p>
        
        <p>Some key takeaways is how he talks about cinema and history;</p>
        
        <p>That the grand retelling of history through these blockbuster films creates a new version of history for the zeitgeist to cling onto; that this new history was not grounded in the real and is a combination of images that have formed from the structures that have pushed into it.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"because the cinema is an image. That is to say not only a screen and a visual form, but a myth, something that still retains something of the double, of the phantasm, of the mirror, of the dream, etc."
        Chapter - Holocaust - Simulacra and Simulations</blockquote>
        
        <p>I apply this thinking of the cinema as an image of itself and a detachment into a double or a phantasm onto all media across all platforms with each person performing and through the images of the platforms and technology including the model and manufacture of the mobile phone one has as a part of the contemporary media system.</p>
        
        <p>Jean beaudrillard applies this same method of thinking to the news reel and to war -</p>
        
        <blockquote>"all "newsreel" footage thus gives the sinister impression of kitsch, of retro and porno at the same time - doubtless everyone knows this, and no one really accepts it. The reality of simulation is unbearable - crueler than Artaud's Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create a dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of blood, of violence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a reabsorption of all the stakes without a trace of blood. For us the trick has been played. All dramaturgy, and even all real writing of cruelty has disappeared. Simulation is the master, and we only have a right to the retro, to the phantom, parodic rehabilitation of all lost referentials."</blockquote>
        
        <h3>Brad Troemel - Art After Social Media</h3>
        
        <p>This week I also read this essay by brad troemel that is featured in the book "You are Here: Art After the Internet" that I have slowly been reading.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout this essay brad talks about the current dilemna artists face having to perform online, navigating a presence and persona and balancing the game between instagram as sincerity or posting as performance.</p>
        
        <p>We exist within platform capitalism and must perform in that manner if we are to either be succesful artists or even just succesful designers through a career.</p>
        
        <p>It brings together my thinking of needing to create more and more artistic output that the more quality content the better. There is something here in the performance that is important.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"The shrinking difference between social networking for the betterment of your art career, and social networking as an art project unto itself, may be part of a greater trend in our contemporary understanding of celebrity."</blockquote>
        
        <h3>The Stack - Benjamin Bratton</h3>
        
        <p>As I began thinking about making zbrush sculptures the sections of the stack started to come to mind that are spcifically about creating metaphors or physical visual descriptions of how to visualise these sometimes abstracted systems.</p>
        
        <p>Some quotes that relate -</p>
        
        <blockquote>"The etymology of platform refers to a 'plan of action, scheme, design' and, from the Middle French, platte form, or, literally, a plateau or raised level surface. As Benedict Singleton writes, this conjoined with the plot, which itself first implies a plot of land. Once situated on the platform of the stage, the 'plot' becomes a more abstract structure that situates characters into the forgone conclusion of its unfolding, even as they suffer the choices that aren't really theirs to make."</blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>"Only after World War II does 'to program' mean 'to write software.' For architecture, computation, and politics, the 'program' has central significance as a design problem and governing technique. The triangulation of designed site, designed action, and designed polis traces that of 'plot': platform and program overlay one another asymmetrically."</blockquote>
        
        <h2>Progress with evidence</h2>
        
        <p>This week I decided to start making and experimenting instead of witholding until i somehow strike a fantastic idea.</p>
        
        <p>I began by coming up with ideas -</p>
        
        <p>initially I was still playing with the idea of multimedia playback a cross various screens and creating a physical sculptural piece using ready made frames and objects. - These are the two mockups I made within maya</p>
        
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pd4FUNn.png" alt="First Image" style="max-width: 300px;"/>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EJNMKgF.png" alt="Second Image" style="max-width: 300px;" />
        
        <p>Ring Light as perfection, of betterment ie closer to god or purity, angelic light etc 4x hdTVs or pc Monitors and 2x Large LED Ring Lights, Ideally linked up to the video interface via arduinos.</p>
        
        <h3>Part 2 - Progress</h3>
        
        <p>I jumped into ZBRUSH to experiment and to practice my skills</p>
        
        <p>Originally I was going to try to make a platform but somehow naturally the piece evolved as I worked with it, incorporating a powerline / cell tower look, interconnecting network like soldered wiring and a sail above. The piece I suppose reflects through "The Stack" and into some conversations I had suroounding AARG and distributive platforms for books and academic papers including annas archive. Set sails on the high seas of this utopic vision of a sculptural piece;; Made while ambiently listening to "a youtube lecture on the stack" and a reuploaded pirate of a private stream of kanyes performance in Korea last week. .....</p>
        
        <p>It's missing any real signifiers but personally I think the material and form allude to this, the curves explicate a more fluid or organic feel. reflecting the well intentioned sharing prevalent in these spaces to democratise access.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8lbEVm0.png" alt="Fifth Image" />
        
        <p>I could pair this with videos playing on loop flapping as flags in the wind. Or with an accompanying datastream abstracted into a video form or something alike.</p>
        
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qm78Uae.png" alt="Sixth Image" />
        
        <p>A speed sculpt withing substance painter where additionally I incorporated a video texture as a test for a different mode of representing the video work.</p>
