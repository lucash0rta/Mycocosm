        <h1>Journal</h1>

        <p>This week is my first week within the studio as I have transferred from a different class. 
        Initially entering the class and hearing the discussions of the plans from the other students in the class. I am getting an understanding the planning boards should take an approach on the key words through a tactile, multi sensory approach. Interweaving mixed media, philosophy, art and sound.</p>
    
        <h2>Tuesday 06/08/2024</h2>
        <h3>The Ai Mirror</h3>
    
        <p>This morning I have woken up, I finished reading "<a href="#" class="obsidian-link">[[The AI Mirror]]</a> by Shannon Vallor" 
        This was a text that was selected for the syllabus for the ACMI Data Visualisation Studio I have just moved out of.</p>
    
        <p>An excerpt from my personal review / notes on the book -</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Throughout the book Shannon highlights repeatedly and through various metaphors and explanations how "AI holds us frozen in place, fascinated by endless permutations of a reflected past that only the magic of marketing can disguise as the future." She speaks on how the tools needed for the immediate future cannot or should not be created from our past."</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>She reminds us aswell of the tale of narcissus.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Like Narcissus, we readily misperceive in this reflection the seduction of an "other"â€”a tireless companion, a perfect future lover, an ideal friend, an unbiased judge, a foolproof collaboratorâ€”yet in truth, a thing with which we are increasingly left alone, talking to ourselves."</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>This book has been intersting and made great points through allegory and interesting refrences. Shannon has laid out a very clear and human way to understand these larger ideas surrounding contemporary AI. However these are regurgitations of ideas that already permeate the zeitgeist.</p>
    
        <h3>Shumon Basar - EndCore and LoreCore</h3>
    
        <p>additional notes in <a href="#" class="obsidian-link">[[LORECORE - Shumon Basar]]</a> &  <a href="#" class="obsidian-link">[[The Dawn of Endcore - Shumon Basar]]</a></p>
    
        <p>Today I have read through Endcore and LoreCore by Shumon Basar
        Accesible here - 
            <a href="https://flash---art.com/article/endcore/">https://flash---art.com/article/endcore/</a>
            <a href="https://zine.zora.co/the-laws-of-lorecore-shumon-basar">https://zine.zora.co/the-laws-of-lorecore-shumon-basar</a></p>
    
        <p>Through these essays Shumon is capturing a feeling, a vibe, shifts in timelines and the general feeling of the internet.</p>
    
        <p>LoreCore is the MCS (Main Charachter Syndrome) many experience as a part of our curated lifestyles on the net. Aswell as stories we tell ourselves and others to romanticise our lives including identity politics.</p>
    
        <p>I am more interested in <strong>EndCore</strong>. The idea is best summarised in this quote -</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"After <a href="https://www.aaschool.ac.uk/publicprogramme/whatson/at-the-end-of-the-end-of-hstry">the end of the end of History</a>. Endcore is the feeling we're in the endgame now: the endgame of climate grief, of technocapitalism, of consensus-based empirical truth, of decency, even. Endcore is the sense of an ending that many people on Earth currently feel, but also the sense that the end never actually arrives. We are Permaending. Cue more Lorecore."</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>When He mentions Permaending Shumon is referencing the current state of this anthropocentric world. A state of perma-crisis</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"an extended period of instability and insecurity, esp one resulting from a series of catastrophic events" - <strong><em>Collins English Dictionary</em></strong></p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>This cataclysmic forever ending is edging us as we never quite reach a climax. It's lead to this unique cacophonous feeling. A mixture of Awe, Horror, Mindlessness, Brainrot, Loss, Spectacle and Sublime.</p>
    
        <p>The extinction is coming and I can't stop watching tiktok remixes.</p>
    
        <p>There is a specific genre of tiktoks that surged in popularity two years ago, around the same time these articles were written. These videos were called "#CoreCore" however as the # was popularised it was adopted by the sigma male influencer accounts and drifted away from the initial broad reflective feeling to mainly inspirational or male depression related content. Due to this its difficult to find tiktoks of which I am referring.</p>
    
        <p>However the overrarching theme is reflected well in this video by shumon basar</p>

        <h3>Twitch Clip - Invadervie</h3>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"the planet is dying, the government hates us, the animals are leaving, the aliens aren't contacting us, we might be along, it just might be you and me, but thats okay because do you really need anyone else"  - invadervie speaking to her audience on livestream - on twitch.io - full rant here - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7w3oEi6NWI&t=34s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7w3oEi6NWI&t=34s</a></p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>- This video encapsulates a tone, a stark realisation that you as the viewer are truly alone, thousands watching this girl that you all fan over. She can never be yours but she'll thank you and tell you you're sweet if you donate. ðŸ˜”</p>
