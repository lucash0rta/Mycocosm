    <h1>Reflection, Research, and Progress</h1>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <div>
        <p>This week I have created a standardised format for my research and reading, organised old readings into my new note taking system, created two tiktok's that serve as reflection of the media I've been consuming and set up a youtube downloader system using cmd and a github project to save and tag videos in a local database alongside all of my tagged photos and saved short form content ie. tiktoks and reels.</p>

        <p>This week I have also reflected on my creative process and found myself revisiting "The Creative Habit" by Thyla Thwarp.</p>

        <p>To quote; <em>"I could prepare, order, organize, structure, and edit my creativity in my head, but I couldn't think my way into a dance. To generate ideas, I had to move. It's the same if you're a painter: You can't imagine the work, you can only generate ideas when you put pencil to paper, brush to canvasâ€”when you actually do something physical."</em></p>

        <p>This book stands as a sort of motivation, or a mantra, I have the audiobook format so it is easy to jump into while in transit or preoccupied; offering guidance and steps to declutter my mind as I attempt to wrangle creative output and extensive theoretical research through readings.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Ongoing Readings;</h3>

        <p>The first two readings play directly into the ideas I am handling creating a work that is using concepts such as James Bridles "New Aesthetic" and technical imagery to infer dense interrelated meaning through signifiers and internet symbology that reveals something in the image.</p>

        <p>The stack has inspired me with key visual language.</p>

        <h4>The Stack - Benjamin Bratton</h4>

        <p>This week as I have been reading The Stack; I found two sections very interesting; a breakdown of the etymology of the words typically used in systems; providing rich visual metaphor I could make use of in my piece.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The etymology of platform refers to a "plan of action, scheme, design" and, from the Middle French, platte form, or, literally, a plateau or raised level surface. As Benedict Singleton writes, this conjoined with the plot, which itself first implies a plot of land. Once situated on the platform of the stage, the "plot" becomes a more abstract structure that situates characters into the forgone conclusion of its unfolding, even as they suffer the choices that aren't really theirs to make. As Singleton would have it, here the plot"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And a breakdown of the new economic system that is prevalent throughout platformed media technologies and companies that sell data and use it to train AI models;</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"(1) User surplus, in which the information is made more valuable for the User once involved with the platform at little or no direct cost to that User, and (2) platform surplus, that is, the differential value of all User information for the platform is greater than the costs of providing the platform to Users."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>You Are Here: Art after the internet</h4>
        <p>Is a collection of short essays from post-internet artists and thinkers. Including James Bridles "New Aesthetic" among many others. These are refreshing and interesting short reads I continually am revisiting.</p>

        <h4>Dirtbag and Neoreactionary</h4>
        <p>The latter two readings although quite political are playing into my understanding of technical images across modern ideological spectrums (being the post-woke dirtbag left and the neo-reactionary futurist right.). As this post-modern world is post-truth and we are all individually living within our own simulacra I am finding it interesting exploring what the world looks like when people free themselves to imagine a better one; whatever that means in their own universe. While reading Neoreaction a Basilisk; I thought it best to read the ideologies of neoreactionary thinkers straight from the mouth of the snakes and so began reading "The Dark Enlightenment" - Nick Land; More a short collection of essays than a book.</p>

        <h4>Digitising Notes</h4>
        <p>This week I have been going through old collections of printed out articles and essays I've read over the last couple of years and have re-read them and organised my ideas; key excerpts and summaries inside the databasing system I have developed for my ongoing project.</p>

        <p>I have constructed a standard template to use for every article;</p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These pieces however mostly political however they deal with life in the anthropocene and digital media as a whole. I believe these are relevant readings for a broad understanding. I want to capture the technical image and through it trigger imagination in my audience. To do this I need extensive references and symbology.</p>

        <h4>Databasing</h4>
        <p>This week I have continued my extensive project of databasing and taggoing.</p>
        
        <p>I have organised a system where I download high quality youtube rips using the github project yt-dlp - 
        <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp</a></p>
        
        <img src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/307260205/b6a8d716-9c7b-40ec-bc44-6422d8b741a0" 
             alt="yt-dlp GitHub project" 
             style="max-width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">
        
        <p>This runs directly from within command prompt and automatically downloads the highest quality versions available. I then bring this into my tagging application; Eagle where they can sit alongside any images, tiktoks, music etc.</p>
        <p>I have gone through and been selective of my recent liked videos on youtube and downloaded about 20 into my database.</p>
        
        

        <p>This week reflecting on my aforementioned readings I have created two tiktoks that serve as reflections.</p>

        <iframe src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/7404062957904137489" allow="fullscreen" height="550px"></iframe>
        <iframe width="300" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AAkN8V_WkP0?si=iBNrglE5kcVXrYIw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>As I was beginning to see the reverie for different people I played some modern American country tunes. While I was listening to it at first I enjoyed the music and the dream like picture painted through the catchy lyricism</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Put a little gravel in my travel<br>
            Unwind, unravel all night long<br>
            Makes me wanna grab you honey<br>
            Tear down some two-lane country<br>
            Who knows<br>
            Get lost and get right with my soul<br>
            Makes me wanna take<br>
            Makes me wanna take a back road"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>While listening to this I thought about how listening to the song on spotify reveals the same underlying ideas of james bridles new aesthetic; I began thinking about the techno-capitalist systems in place that serve audiences this music. About the inauthenticity that reveals so much about the PR-ification of aesthetics and culture, tying through to jean beaudrillards ideas on simulacra.</p>
        <p>To quote the late mark fisher "All that is solid melts into PR"</p>
        <p>And so I decided to make a short tiktok trying to capture what I was imagining. (uploaded on youtube as tiktok copyright removed the audio)</p>
