    <h2>September 23 - 29th</h2>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This week, I delved into "Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" and explored related concepts through various media. I worked on preparing mockup models for a gallery space, finalizing sculpture forms, and taking measurements. Using AI tools like Marigold depth estimation, I created digital works resembling moulds or rock carvings. I reconfigured my Raspberry Pi, attempted a Linux installation, and repurposed old Bluetooth headphones for a sound experiment, leading me to purchase a soldering kit for my project. My ongoing readings included "Simulacra and Simulation," "Communicology," and "You Are Here: Art After the Internet." On Friday, during an internet outage, I was impressed by Ollama's offline capabilities in providing information about Benjamin's essay, sparking thoughts about future offline resource potential. I successfully connected a new display to my Raspberry Pi for video playback and began testing audio using salvaged Bluetooth headset parts. Additionally, I researched electronics and Arduino systems, watched educational videos on microcomputers, and enjoyed a lecture by Cory Doctorow on internet "enshittification" and its impact on end-users.</p>

    <h3>Diary Entry Friday 27th</h3>
    <p>This morning, my internet wasn't working, so I asked Ollama (running locally) for an overview of Walter Benjamin's _Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction_. I was amazed that my laptop provided the correct author, year, and a basic summaryâ€”all without internet or the text on my device. This made me wonder about the potential of offline resources; in 10 years, a natural language model could run on a Raspberry Pi or microcomputer, containing vast amounts of information. I also connected my new display to the Raspberry Pi and successfully played video, using a power hub with enough output to last for hours. I'm now testing audio using parts from an old Bluetooth headset. I still need to buy a soldering iron, a setup for it, and wire strippers. Here's the specific LCD module I'm using: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DtuOeeYHys">YouTube link</a>.</p>

    <h2>Ongoing Research</h2>
    <p>This week, I delved into electronics and Arduino systems, exploring their capabilities for displaying video, images, and controlling various displays and actuators. Through YouTube tutorials, I expanded my understanding of these microcomputers' potential and limitations</p>

    <p>I watched this great lecture by Cory Doctorow - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EmstuO0Em8">DEF CON 32 - Disenshittify or die! How hackers can seize the means of computation - Cory Doctorow</a></p>

    <p>I have heard Cory speak on various podcasts in the past and his ideas behind the enshittification of the internet had already made their way into my vocabulary, and maybe a term that turns out a title of one of his books titled chokepoint capitalism. As I have been working through texts surrounding media studies and the new media and communication systems this word had kept coming to me. Most likely as his texts are well regarded and circulate chat channels I lurk in this term has entered my vocabulary in a rather pervasive way.</p>

    <p>This lecture by corey was succinct but allowed some very clear metaphors to be taken in regards to how the internet is collapsing in on itself as capitalism roams free and how as end users we are being more and more tread on and no longer cared about due to monopolistic tactics and reward systems prevailent across the net today.</p>

    <p>This week, I expanded my theoretical foundation by reading "Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" and continuing my study of "Simulacra and Simulation" and "Communicology." I also revisited the essay collection "You Are Here: Art After the Internet".</p>

    <p>I conducted some early research into the benefits of workflows of using linux to interface with local ai models and have installed ubuntu on my laptop to test out some experiments with the depth estimation system.</p>

    <h2>Progress With Evidence</h2>
    <p>This week, I focused on refining my mockup models for a fake gallery space, locking in the final forms of the sculptures and taking detailed measurements. I also explored AI tools, particularly Marigold depth estimation, to experiment with extracting depth from images. These experiments aimed to create digital works that evoke the textures of moulds or rock carvings, blending organic and digital aesthetics.</p>

    <p>In addition, I reconfigured my Raspberry Pi, installed Linux, and disassembled an old pair of Bluetooth headphones to test new speakers by directly connecting cables to the soundboard. After successful testing, I decided to purchase a soldering kit to integrate this into my final project.</p>

    <p>This image shows a painting passed through depth estimation, re-rendered in Blender, digitized, processed through AI, and rendered again. These processes highlight the interplay between human input and machine automation, resulting in a distorted, uncanny effect that reflects both the collaboration and the friction between digital and physical mediums.</p>
