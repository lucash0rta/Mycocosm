    <h1>Week 5 Reflection</h1>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This week I have been following my previously outlined plan of attempting to wrangle ideas of reverie through a lense of digital media analysis and philosophical / political theory. With an aim to extract from the fringes of the extremes the codified imagery that makes people's reverie. Or triggers the more original a priori feeling.</p>
    <p>Additionally this week I have spent alot of time at extra curricular activities namely various NOWORNEVER events at the Royal Exhibition Building and a lecture by author Catherine Liu</p>
    <p>I have continued scouring the internet for found footage, adding tomy database and reflecting on my process.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>NOWORNEVER - Ben Frost / CORIN / Eartheater / Gabber Modus Operandi</h3>
    <h4>Ben Frost</h4>
    <p>This event was very affecting; the absolute torrent of audio visual sound, navigating emotions and raw feeling that was ben frost's set. There were moments of ecstasy, bliss and an overwhelming brutal incapacitating feeling. The set was impactful with lighting design to match.</p>

    <h4>Eartheater</h4>
    <p>A cultural mash of various aesthetics and cultural influencer, pop artist eartheater guided the audience through a beauiful set through various emotional sways that felt like a narrative was being woven through the set. Eartheater, based in queens, originally born in Pennsylvania to a Russian father and an English mother.</p>
    <p>It felt like a transcendence of culture and signifiers into a new identity, one that I think many first generation neoliberal-raised through the anthropocene- gen-z types with cybercigil tattoos intensely resonate. It feels authentic, it felt like pain and sadness and something raw that existed outside of the traditional signifiers of these things. Or of a trancscendance from them through an evolution of them.</p>

    <h4>Gabber Modus Operandi</h4>
    <p>My friend santino said to me he'd never heard "resteroative gabber" before 
    This term lands perfectly with the style of music. HArdstyle, Gabber, dangdut koplo (Indonesian folk music), Chicago footwork, grindcore, noise music and jathilan (Javanese ritualised trance-dance) This set evolved through time, using these abstractions of music, globalism, the internet as the affect that created the music and as the instantiation of AWE.</p>
    <p>This set felt in touch, grounded and yet abstract. with massive ai interpretations or looped videos to match that were not decorative but additive.   -- at one point in the set we sat down for a two minute meditation which acted as the perfect pit stop for the intense dancing thaat ensued and as a touchpoint for grounding.. Awe, humor, sillyness,  they made technology their own through their cultural touch points, through their art. This can be said for the whole night and that is how I see the curatorial flow working despite these artists genres somewhat being disparate.</p>

    <h2>Like An Event In A Dream Dreamt By Another — Rehearsal - Firas Shehadeh</h2>
    <img src="https://images.mubicdn.net/images/film/409361/cache-959783-1713006677/image-w1280.jpg?size=800x" alt="">
    <p>Throughout this reading Firas Shehdeh spoke about the use of modding as "a way of hijacking meaning and ideology by taking control of the inaccessible technology and subverting the dominant narratives"</p>
    <p>Throughout this text firas outlines a history of some influential video games and mods that told a story that exists outside and against the American imperial machine and therefor its capitalistic engine which drives the ideologies and industry of warfare video games such as Tom Clancy, Call of Duty etc.</p>
    <p>"Under Ash provides an alternative for Palestinian youth to play from their own perspective while Special Force feels more like a role reversal of American games with Israelis as bad guys. Under Ash creators wanted to design a game Palestinian players can relate to based on their daily struggles. Special Force seems more focused on turning the tables ideologically through a vehemently anti-Israeli narrative."</p>

    <h4>Relevance and takeaways</h4>
    <p>The relevance of this piece is that the reverie looks culturally different for different people, howver through modding firas was able to construct a new narrative. The importance is that the want for cultural refrence touchpoints or relatable symbology provides the player with a personal connection. In this context it provides the "image" of the AAA video game, of piracy, of hacking and community. These technical images weave together to create the piece.</p>
    <p>This is reflective of my goal; to touch people through these technical images and personal touchstones.</p>

    <h1>Ongoing Readings - Books</h1>
    <h4>Jean Baudrillard -  Simulacra and Simulation</h4>
    <p>I'm about one third through this book now. 
    AsI'm reading the ideas the authoris unceovering and exposing feel raw and truthful. That we now live in a simulated world deteched from the real that all action and inaction could be explained away through simulation.</p>
    <p>How even "holdups, airplane hijackings, etc. are now in some sense simulation holdups in that they are already inscribed in the decoding and orchestration rituals of the media, anticipated in their presentation and their possible consequences. In short, where they function as a group of signs dedicated exclusively to their recurrence as signs, and no longer at all to their "real" end"</p>
    <p>This is all very bleak that history has happened, culture has happened and now we are reliving it. I like to think the excited will be in the distortions, clashes, artifacting or hallucination of something new.</p>
    <p>Jean Baudrillard unpacks cinema, politics, war, nostalgia, fascism, the world wars, the vietnam war and the movie Apocalypse Now.</p>
    <p>I think that with so many films clearly inspired by Jean Beaudrillards work that I have internalised a knowing of these sort of theories. And therefor am not wildly blown away by a deeper reading. 
    I feel as though a watch through of Fight Club, The Matrix, Synechdoche New York and The Truman Show, could lead you to an emotive understanding to these ideas. However his posits through politics are interesting I am struggling to decipher something new or unspoken.</p>
    <p>I may spend another day reading this text but I will cut myself off and try to find something more about using imagery to trigger emotive states instead of a complex philosophical breakdown of modern life and how we turned into simulation detached from the real (we as in western neoliberal states in the global economy).</p>

    <h4>Nick Land - The Dark Enlightenment</h4>
    <p>I'm about 2/3 of the way through this book, nick has a very interesting style of writing.
    The text is rambling, jumping between and drawing racist conclusions surrounding global control and some rambling racist theories surrounding divides in the working classes.</p>
    <p>I am reading this as I was previously reading a book that analysed and tore apart this type of neoreactionary literature including Nick Land's work</p>
    <p>I didn't believe that they would be so blatantly out right racist and clearly making up their own conclusions as they went along. I was wrong, It is a mess.</p>
    <p>I believe this will still be useful to comprehend; 
    In the below update on Jean Beuadrillard's "Simulacra and Simulation" there i specific thought where that fascism originally emerged as a reaction to the world of the hyperreal or the world becoming a simulation. Jean Beaudrillard goes on to speak of how it could exist again through the fetishisation of the aesthetics of the simulated version or romanticised version of fascism. I am trying to grapple with what this cause is. This is especially pertinent as JD Vance being trumps running mate in the american election shows clearly; with some of JD Vance's being neoreactionary thinkers and one being the most influential modern blogger Curtis Yarvin; An understanding how this new rise of thinking has become so popular is important  to tear apart where their reverie lies.</p>
    <p>There is mention of the great exit. of choosing to leave America and establish a new state, free from everybody they despise to be able to accelerate without restriction or safety gaurdrails through a techno utopian future. I think it would be interesting to paint this picture. A landscape of their dream. To somehow tie a humanising narrative that connects these weird abstracted ideals into that one universal feeling.</p>
    <p>Again this book is not engaging my creative juices and the previous critiques I had read of this thinking were spot on. I didn't think they would actually play into these tropes so much; I thought maybe there could be something interesting lying underneath but frankly I think it's garbage.</p>



    <h2>Progress with Evidencers</h2>
    <p>This week I have edited two new tiktoks;</p>
    <p>These pieces are definitely off the mark of reverie although I was mainly trying to experiment with aesthetics of the digital and beauty.</p>
    <p>The first being overlays of AI footage, butcher videos, sex-doll manufacturing and other body horror clips. This aimed to instantiate a feeling through a collapsing of the gore aesthetic into something incomprehendable. A washing over of the brain, this overlay technique could be used for the reverie inducing clips as a way to withhold the feeling while abstracting or destroying the recognisable image.</p>
    <p>The second tiktok is a clip from a twitch streamer. 
    Twitch is interesting as an addictive machine, a template for drip fed human interaction to audiences; where lude gets hits and saying crazy or funny things go viral. There is something of beauty in the way people spend so long idly watching, the "appropriate" or allowed content on the site and how its mechanisms thrive when creators skate along that edge.</p>
