        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>Through the web experiments and the sculptural experiments I explored last week in zbrush, maya, substance painter, and the web based experiment of incorporating a 3d scene into a website. And after hearing so much about acting or reenacting the AI, about the fake, the hyperreal, there is much to be said about it. Just as placing a art object into a gallery space says something, to weld a metal sculpture says something, to bring together a multisensory display is to say something but for the majority, people do not go to the gallery, they only see the documentation. I have realised that these mediums of sculptural practice are about the image they imbue on the object, that the materials, sourcing, texture etc, add to the codified meaning. But these codified meanings are not limited to physical objects in the new real. That the hyppereal is just as much the real and so to create new sculptural pieces, collages, of sculpted objects, everyday goods, high fidelity rendering and a fake gallery space would be a fast and iterative method I could use to create a new practice.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GMofTfv.jpeg" alt="Image 3" style="max-width: 300px;">
    
        <p>These Sculptural objects may aswell be renderings as far as I see, the devil is in the details. It would be an interesting excercise.</p>
    
        <p>Part of this thinking ties in with a Brad Troemel Piece I read last week week in "You Are Here: Art After the Internet"</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The shrinking difference between social networking for the betterment of your art career, and social networking as an art project unto itself, may be part of a greater trend in our contemporary understanding of celebrity"</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>This sort of thinking of instagram posting as performance work. I will become the idealised artist; a multimodal prolific creator, an AI generated water colour painting sat on an easel in maya in a realistic studio setting with the same camera angle and aperture of my iphone. I first started by experimenting with 3 pieces, taking an image, passing it through an ai IMG - IMG generator, printing it out and drawing on it. This is the same form. To make this prank believable I may need to source images online of fake studios or to get friends to take photos of lets say a clay oven / kindle or woodworking tools etc.</p>
    
        <h2>Research</h2>
    
        <h3>Notes on readings</h3>
    
        <p>I decided to continue my reading of Gaston Bachelard - On Poetic Imagination and Reverie;</p>
    
        <p>I had received feedback that I should connect with the word first and think about it. Reading this book it is very poetic in the way he talks about these ideas linking poetry, imagination and the way we think of images and their connection to a priori feelings.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"From the standpoint of its will to shape expression, the literary image is a physical reality that has its own relief. More precisely, it is the psychic relief, the multi-leveled psyche. It furrows or it raises; it finds a depth or suggests an elevation; it rises or falls between haven and earth. It is polyphonic because it is polysemantic. If meanings become too profuse, it can fall into wordplay. If it restricts itself to a single meaning, it can fall into didacticism. The true poet avoids both dangers. He plays and he teaches. In him, the word reflects and reflows; in him time begins to wait. The true poem awakens an unconquerable desire to be reread. We immediately have the impression that the second reading will tell more than the first. And the second reading – contrary to an intellectual reading – is slower than the first. It is contemplative. We never finish dreaming the poem, never finish thinking it. And sometimes there comes a great line, one charged with such pain or such thought that the reader – the solitary reader – murmurs: on that day, I shall read no further."</p>
        </blockquote>
            <p>This section at the beginning of at the beginning of the chapter titled - Poetic Images Condense Infinite Meanings in Elliptic Associations</p> <p>It evokes a feeling, It makes me remember that true creation or art is somewhere between thought and action, of natural movement, a flow. </p> Though this depends on how some see art.
            <p>It reminds me of pollock</p>
            <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/60da2a060458516d04fb196a/4ffdfef1-9c8f-4982-8b22-57a0e0e326e1/jackson+pollock+working+on+a+painting.jpg" alt="Pollock">
    


    
        <h3>The Stack (Ongoing Reading)</h3>
    
        <p>Benjamin bratton speaks on the standardisation of protocols and how systems form and shape around the organisations that build them and their politics or ideological framework.</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The history of these technologies is also then the history of multiple competing communication standards. Protocol politics is always rough trade because to control the standard is to influence the economies it enables, which is to influence how they interrelate with other systems and the meta-economies those interoperations in turn give rise to."</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <h2>Talks and Reflections</h2>
    
        <p>This week I attended talks by mckenzie wark and jennifer walsh.</p>
    
        <p>Because I took in so much information I decided to type frantically out my thoughts, this could be seen as a method of practice based research where I am connecting my thoughts after taking in new information.</p>
    
        <p>I will overview a map that connects all the research</p>

        <p>I'm thinking about the image. the new image, language or the compilation. I thought first of if the new technical image is all, than how would you write in minecraft.. how would one structure a codified sentence or paper into a game world.</p>
    
        <p>The method could be to write the thought and then bring the different materials that exert those ideas through their form together into one object. Just as in sculptural practice where the materials, form, colour, texture show or allude to concepts. This would be executed by film grain, camera iso, device rendered on / game engine. this could be a ui overlay or a specific animation it could be a symbol or a tone of colour often seen in a specific place....</p>
    
        <p>These are what form the technical image and then the languages of not just the interfaces but also presentation i.e. desktop, print, book, all play into this codified object. I mean this feels obvious now that I type it out but it ties all together. James Bridle and the new aesthetic, Hito Steyerl and the crunched image - now those images contain the image imprinted by the popularity of these pieces and contain that additional contextuality. Similarly, Pepe the frog now carries the history of liberals decrying it as a symbol of hate speech. These new narratives become codified onto themselves. The challenge lies in how to meaningfully create with these dense points of interconnected references. How do we navigate and utilize these complex, layered meanings in our creative processes?</p>
    
        <p>Specific AI models, UI, creative tools, the mediums, the methods of creation... now that I think of this as a part of my practice. As this is the most important thing to happen right now... the language has been evolving... aesthetics prevailed this codified meaning.. a sort of nostalgia core that revealed these things or blend additional aesthetics with their own reference points, stylistic choices etc. Design is not design, it is the ability to pull from the mass of data and curate something interesting to juxtapose two things or to position it in a new way,. This feels like Duchamp... what would he do if he were here today.</p>
    
        <p>A sort of new scope is necessary.... There is a finite number of codified images but scratch that - the codified image is interpreted through each individual's simulacra or simulated universe through their own unique lens.</p>
    
        <p>In this sense the user is the conduit. The viewer or listener. Hearing all a conglomeration of histories or references that relate to all in their own way. Angelicism01 was able to execute this with clear flows and in many ways Jennifer Walsh's piece tonight reminded me heavily of it, mainly the format of having these separated stanzas or an overarching structure... however Angelicism01 was referencing or cutting back later on or making meta commentary at different points, revealing the film, the medium through time as they play with the thoughts, time, reproducibility,. All that shit.</p>
    
        <p>During this week I realised that I had to read communicology, this book is a key theoretical understanding of discourse, images, power structures and the media. I have tried to read this book several times in the past but never stuck with it however this time I plan to and use it as a key part of my research.</p>
    
        <h2>Progress With Evidence</h2>
    
        <p>I AI Generated this image the other day at jennifer walshes workshop -</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FHiOPPL.jpeg" alt="AI Generated Image" style="max-width: 300px;">
    
        <p>I've come to realize that, even though I can't paint, I can still incorporate paintings into my work. By using an easel, a canvas, this painting, an iPhone photo, and an Instagram story caption with a preset filter, I can create a believable composition. I can incorporate any technical art, painting, sculpture, or medium that I can't create myself, treating them as tools to convey the imprinted meanings derived from aesthetics, form, labor, care, and thought processes.</p>
    
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EEhq0Fe.png" alt="Instagram Post" style="max-width: 300px;">
    
        <p>This is a post I put on my instagram captioned "Fun day doodling." A slow performance or prank is necessary to trick the audience into believing that my artistic process has been built up and then executed with thought, technical skill and vision. But all of it will be completely digital.</p>
    
        <p>I can incorporate music, video, various channels of videos or gameplay aswell as 3d models, zbrush sculptures etc. into collages, take some images from different angles and make it look real.</p>
