<h1>Weekly Progress Journal</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This week has been incredibly productive. I've focused on several key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing ongoing scenes</li>
  <li>Learning After Effects for creating clean, interesting motion graphic transitions</li>
  <li>Experimenting with multi-camera overlays and green screens to achieve unique effects that break free from traditional shots and framing</li>
  <li>Creating and implementing 3D models and diagrams within shots</li>
  <li>Editing and developing 3D animations</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I've made progress on the physical object through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuous development of the physical components</li>
  <li>Designing and laser cutting the housing box for electronics and screens</li>
  <li>Testing the pulley system</li>
  <li>Multiple layers of white spray paint application and sanding to obscure the 3D print layer lines, making the puppet's material less identifiable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research</h2>

<h2>Progress with Evidence</h2>

<h3>Audio Development</h3>
<p>I dedicated significant time to refining the audio in my scenes, working iteratively between Ableton and the video piece. This involved adding foley and atmospheric sounds that complemented the visuals. For the first portion of the video, I even incorporated <i>MIDI instruments</i>.</p>

<h3>Physical Object Refinement</h3>
<p>I've been applying several coats of paint to achieve a cleaner finish on the finalized object, focusing on eliminating layer lines to achieve a smooth white finish on the doll. Simultaneously, I've been designing and testing the final box design.</p>

<p>This process presented several challenges:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Insufficient space allocation for screen cables within the box</li>
  <li>Limited access to plywood at the makerspace (1 sheet per day allowance)</li>
  <li>Difficulty sourcing 90-degree cable adapters from Jaycar</li>
</ol>

<p>I ultimately modified an HDMI cable using various tools - a delicate process that, despite some close calls, proved successful.</p>

<p>The spray paint sourcing journey was equally challenging:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bunnings: Undergoing renovations</li>
  <li>Art supply store: Sold out of white spray paint</li>
  <li>Builder's supply store: Mistakenly provided temporary spray and mark paint</li>
  <li>Finally succeeded at Eckersleys in the city</li>
</ul>

<h3>Video Editing and Experimentation</h3>

<p>This week involved intensive learning through YouTube tutorials at 2x speed, researching new workflows to expand my creative capabilities and production value. I specifically focused on learning <i>After Effects</i> for particular scenes.</p>

<p>I'm working to incorporate clean transitions in my scenes, drawing inspiration from these videos. I believe these smooth transitions enhance the surreal nature of the work, particularly in moments where 3D assets transform into icons:</p>
