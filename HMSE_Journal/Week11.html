        <h1>Week 11</h1>
<p>September 30th - October 6th</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Throughout this week I have experimented with codebases to run the esp32 with a screen, tested the arduino which didn't end up working and ran not just the round screen displays for the first time but also learnt more about the workflow concerning converting a gif to code that is suitable for the micro controllers.</p>

<p>My research was mainly technical this week researching these various topics.</p>

<p>In addition i made my way to the makerspace to attempt to create a 3d print for a vertical motor mechanism. Through the printing I learnt more about the constraints of 3d printing parts, the differences in density, time to print etc. and how the supports systems interacts with the final amount of work required to tidy the final product.</p>

<p><em>Trial by fire, lots of filing, sanding, drilling etc..</em></p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>This week I conducted research into esp32 code bases for displaying images and running motors, how to setup the wiring and research into vertical motor setups as the motor rotates 180 degrees I need to convert this into a vertical setup with my push puppet re design I am thinking of</p>

<p>I also did some research into the alternative use cases of the esp32's. Due to the onboard bluetooth and wifi functionalities the esp32 can support local hosting of websites, I find this interesting as an idea for the final piece to be able to incorporate qr code interactions for links to either further text, an essay, or the interactive websites I had built earlier in the semester.</p>

<p>I also conducted some preliminary research into how or if it would be feasible to use cheap subwoofers from aliexpress.</p>

<p>This method is a bit more complicated than I initially thought as it needs additional voltage flowing into the speaker where you need a driver, the amplitude effects the sound output volume and resonance and therefore it complicates things and a driver is necessary. Due to this being somewhat more complex than I had anticipated makes me think I should not pursue this method.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>This week i went to the maker space several times to begin working on my iterative design process, constructing the sculptural element of my piece. I began by first downloading and then adjusting designs in blender and maya, I began from scratch with learning to import and export stl files, ways to convert more non standard 3d mockup design files.</p>

<p>I also worked on the code for displaying visuals on the esp32 and the round micro displays. However I did find that one of my displays was broken --</p>

<p>It still looks good with a visual that takes over the whole screen and is animated however I have decided to adjust my final project scale due to this. I also believe that a new scale with only one screen for the face will be a more manageable project as I will be able to iterate faster with the 3d printer. I research which cables go where and how to correctly connect the screen with the device and did much trial and error by gleaning from different youtube videos and adjusting / customising code for my own needs.</p>

<p>I also went to bunnings to source some mdf as I am planning to construct the box and final objects, I picked up a saw, some nails and a vice. This was in plans to then work on the project and use some thick wood as a breadboard to nail in the electronic components and to test how they all work before constructing the final piece.</p>

<p>When I arrived home however I was sawing, nailing etc. trying to make a small base and to construct this, i also found wood scraps on the side of the road to use as supports however I found this method to be tedious and ineffective. I don't have a work bench at home and was trying to do this on the floor and it just wouldn't work very well.</p>

<p>I also setup an esp32 with video output to a tft rectangle display I had, this was tedious as I initially thought i could use an arduino although it was not working with the limited capacities of the arduino's memory base.</p>
