    <h1>October 7 - October 13th 2024</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This week I spent my Thursday and Friday in the makerspace again, unfortunately one of the staff members that oversees the space has been sick recently and so the makerspace has been shut from monday to Wednesday.</p>
    
    <p>However I aimed to make solid progress while i was in the maker space, I printed out my doll and went through various iterative design decisions. Initially I did a test print of the head and the body with less infill, these were to how the infill interacts with the print.</p>
    
    <p>I then decided that for the rest off the parts i would need to do 100% infill as it means that while drilling the 3d printed parts would stay. I will discuss further in my progress report below.</p>
    
    <p>In regards to research this week, as I was beginning to make the visuals side of the project in unity I decided that I had to expand my horizons, I did a speed reading of James bridle's "New dark age" This book was very informing in regards to the structures of the net once again, and more leaning into the infrastructure that is guiding us into the</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>This week I decided I would finish communicology once and for all as it I felt as though i needed the ideas solidified to finish my project, I felt as if there was something left to uncover and there definitely was</p>

        <h1>Notes on Futurology and Media Theory</h1>
        
        <h2>Wednesday Notes: Photography and Futurology</h2>
        
        <p>Some notes and thoughts after reading on wednesday on futurology and the way vilem flusser talks about photography.</p>
        
        <p>- But it is also a project: it is how future photographs might be. Therefore, it is an aspect of the future. The sum of all the possible mirror reflections is the universe of all possible photographs, and what the photographer sees while looking for a point of view is a specific section of the future. This is futurology, not prophecy, because it projects the present into the future and thus preempts the future. Prophecy is the opposite motion: it projects the future into the present and thus preempts the present. In other words, the decision of the photographer to press the button is a decision in favor of a future aspect he likes.</p>
        
        <p>- Is this not the larger game: positioning ourselves in MMOs, playing roles, collecting achievements to fulfill our dream? The collective decision-making leads through this predictable future, like the apparatus-operator complex with the camera. We see aesthetics, styles, and character customizability. We exist in a form of futurology, schismed across time. Even when we exist in the now, that moment is one we prescribe to ourselves, necessitating some idea of rest that plays into the wider game.</p>
        
        <h2>Thursday Notes: Extended Thoughts on Communicology</h2>
        
        <p>Then on thursday after finishing the book I decided to write out some rambling ideas and notes connecting some readings throughout the semester into a longer more cohesive thought.</p>
        
        <p>Today I finished the final chapter of <em>Communicology</em> by Vilem Flusser, I had been wanting to read this book for some time but it is now that I realise how well it really explains our current relationship with history, with time, space and media. One of the most poignant parts of the final chapter was how history is no longer linear, that we are at the center of space-time and filter history through a view of importance.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I do not <em>become</em>; I stand always still; it is the world that comes toward me; it <em>becomes me</em>." - Page 192, Communicology</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This linear history is, in fact, a fake, mediated history that is being fed back to us through methods of communication, and we draw from the archive as we wish.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"It consists of cutting history and gluing it together again in a way that produces a trompe l'imagination (a movie) in the receivers. It consists of transforming history into a movie story. But nothing is achieved by calling this bad faith on the part of the operators. By transforming true story into trompe-histoire, this sort of recodification shows that true history is just as fictitious as is a movie story and that to commit oneself to history is pure folly." - Page 173 - Communicology</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>These images flow into one another but now with many layers of feedback loops and market incentives, with AI bots reacting, watching, and playing into recommendation algorithms to enhance performance and reaction. It stands outside of the sphere that Flusser predicted; we are all distorted within the market. Will the mainstream media scape continue down this hole? What will become of history? It reminds me of how Jean Baudrillard speaks about the Vietnam War and the Coppola film <em>Apocalypse Now</em>.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"One revisits everything through cinema and one begins again: the Molochian joy of filming, the sacrificial joy of so many millions spent, of such a holocaust of means, of so many misadventures, and the remarkable paranoia that from the beginning conceived of this film as a historical, global event, in which, in the mind of the creator, the war in Vietnam would have been nothing other than what it is, would not fundamentally have existed - and it is necessary for us to believe in this: the war in Vietnam 'in itself' perhaps in fact never happened, it is a dream, a baroque dream of napalm and of the tropics, a psychotropic dream that had the goal neither of a victory nor of a policy at stake, but, rather, the sacrificial, excessive deployment of a power already filming itself as it unfolded, perhaps waiting for nothing but consecration by a superfilm, which completes the mass-spectacle effect of this war." - Jean Beaudrillard, Apocalypse Now</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This double fake, this new understanding of the history and that each person can read the signs and symbols drawn from history through their individual interpretations</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"If painting The Scream today, the appropriate backdrop would not be the blood-red sky of Krakatoa's eruption, but a firmament criss-crossed with contrails: the same contrails that litter the websites of chemtrail conspiracy theorists, even, if not especially, those who deny the realities of man-made climate change. We are all looking at the same sky and seeing radically different things." - The New Dark Age, James Bridle</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This thinking that we all see the same things, maybe slightly different however that everybody from their individualistic or community driven ideologies identify with and tear apart technical images in their own way sand decipher their meanings through their own lenses is exactly how each of us see the world.</p>
        
        <p>However their may be a new paranoid feeling that pervades the contemporary man if their is an understanding of the technical image and the subversive tactics used by state, private and individuals using the tools of control as they are of free access now.</p>
        
        <p>We can all become grifters in this new world - as mentioned in the new dark age further -</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"In 2012, two brothers from Veles set up a website called HealthyFoodHouse.com. They stuffed it with weight-loss tips and recommendations for alternative remedies, culled from wherever they could find them on the internet, and over the years it drew more and more visitors. Their Facebook page has 2 million subscribers, and 10 million come to the site every month, drawn, via Google, to articles with titles like 'How To Get Rid of The Folds On Your Back And Sides in 21 Days' and '5 Soothing Essential Oils To Rub On Your Sciatic Nerve For Instant Pain Relief'. With the visitors, the AdSense earnings started rolling in: the brothers became local celebrities and spent their money on fast cars and bottles of champagne in Veles's nightclubs."</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This also links through to the ideas of e-deologies and the subversive tactics that radical teenagers use to leverage the social media algrorithims to expose wider audiences to their content. As mentioned in "The Slow Red Pill" - Joshua Citarella -</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"by all outward appearances it would look like a regular conservative Instagram page. This account would repost high-performing content from big Republican pages (@DC_Draino, @the_typical_liberal, etc) and use the popularity of these images to accumulate a following of Fox, Breitbart and Turning Point USA-type viewers. About once a week, the account would unexpectedly post extreme content."</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Not just are these people using these techniques of the platform to leverage to create an outreach they are purporting their own experience of history and are examples exactly of how fluser describes our new relationship with history and how time is situated with our interest now.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"It is the closer the more I become interested in it (interest = to be involved). The only scale of measurement such a space admits is a scale that measures my interest in the objective world. Such a scale may become as exact as are the scales of classical physics. If one accepts that the mathesis of the objective world is my interest in it, my interest becomes just as quantifiable as are centimeters and seconds" - Communicology, Page 196</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This measurement of interest has been the aim of the platforms of the 21st century to quantify, to calculate, to predict and from that form recommendations which aid advertisers in finding their targets, whether via their desires or repulsions to engage with the advertised content. In turn people create content to supply the demands and quantified crossover desires, unexpected or seemingly unexplainable interests, rule 42 and everyone throwing shit at the wall until it sticks then we strike gold in the attention economy, the bots notice it, industries are created, more people are targetted in their own complex venn diagrams of consumer profiles and we see the enshittified internet emerge. Introduce AI generated slop into this equation and we are beginning to see the outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>This in conjunction with the now established market system of The Long Tail. A term originally coined by Chris Anderson in his wired article and then later developed into Novel - "The Long Tail"</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"What's really amazing about the Long Tail is the sheer size of it. Combine enough nonhits on the Long Tail and you've got a market bigger than the hits. Take books: The average Barnes & Noble carries 130,000 titles. Yet more than half of Amazon's book sales come from <em>outside</em> its top 130,000 titles." - Wired, Chris Anderson, October 1st 2004.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>We've seen this all play out and now we see history itself enshittified, Ai generated products or niche seemingly weird media created by real humans that seemingly tapped into both the market conditions of the net and the half dazed brains of the consumer binging on mindless gloop.</p>
        
        <p>So what though? I think we understand all of these things just through participating in this, that it is a feeling of the now. That all of these things are and have been clear for some time, it is 2024. to be exact the 10/10/2024</p>

            <h4>Communicology Quotes & Notes:</h4>

            <p><strong>On specialists and knowledge:</strong> <em>"The specialists cannot teach us because they themselves do not know what they are doing."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On technical images and mass communication:</strong> <em>"Operators of technical images on the elite level of communication have technical imagination, while those on the mass level do not... It is intolerable to be programmed in a state of lack of awareness by operators who themselves lack awareness of what they are doing."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On historical awareness of media:</strong> <em>"People were more aware of the meaning of films at the time of the Lumière brothers than they are at present."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On photographer-apparatus relationship:</strong> <em>"He uses his apparatus for his decisions, but he decides regarding his apparatus. He does not move with the apparatus or against it; he does not motivate the apparatus, nor is he motivated by it."</em></p>

            <p>Note: The relationship with apparatus and how mediation and understanding of the world through homogenous technology. Phones, word processors, platforms etc. Flattens us as more of our life is filtered through this relationship.</p>

            <p><strong>On technical imagination:</strong> <em>"Technical imagination is not value-free... but it stands on a level that is different from historical, political, and ethical evaluation: it aims at good photographs of the world."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On sharing photographs:</strong> <em>"Photographs are points of view meant to be shared with others, and the more they are thus shared, the truer they are and the better they are."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On TV and conditioning:</strong> <em>"The images and sounds that emanate from the TV function like drugs: they are habit forming. The more they supply the receiver with sensations, the more they condition him or her for further consumption."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On human existence and codes:</strong> <em>"Human life is meaningless, in a sense applicable only to humans and to no other animal; humans exist, which implies that they know they are going to die. This knowledge of death is knowledge of the ultimate meaninglessness of living. The purpose of codes is to make life meaningful in spite of such knowledge."</em></p>

            <h4>Other Books:</h4>

            <p><strong>From New Dark Age - On conspiracy theories:</strong> <em>"Many conspiracy theories, then, might be a kind of folk knowing: an unconscious augury of the conditions, produced by those with a deep, even hidden, awareness of current conditions and no way to articulate them in scientifically acceptable terms."</em></p>

            <p><strong>From Simulacra and Simulation - On modern culture:</strong> <em>"Our only culture in the end is that of hydrocarbons, that of refining, cracking, breaking cultural molecules and of their recombination into synthesized products."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On mass cultural practice:</strong> <em>"From today, the only real cultural practice, that of the masses, ours (there is no longer a difference), is a manipulative, aleatory practice, a labyrinthine practice of signs, and one that no longer has any meaning."</em></p>

            <p><strong>On information and meaning:</strong> <em>"We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning."</em></p>

<p>This week I continued working on my project in the makerspace, refining my design, drilling holes, piecing my puppet together and testing the electronics</p>
<p>This work is a lot more time intensive than I had initially anticipated, the 3d prints come out with support structures that are stuck to the prints and therefor have to be carefully cut away</p>
<p>Figuring out how the pully system best works and going through trial and error to adjust the standing position</p>
<p>After the trial and error I have several different lines of wire that connect the doll individually, legs, arms, head etc to maintain a good pose while standing</p>
<p>I also had to modify my design however with limitations on availability to the 3d printers i had to adjust and work with what I had, the legs originally designed in between the shoes and shorts became replacement parts for the arms that didnt print well.</p>
<p>I used several different size drill bits and encountered issues such as the glue melting when drilling</p>
<p>Through this practice I naturally discovered better workflows  when handling 3d prints, ie going slow while drilling, placing the parts in a vice, however padding between the vice and the doll was necessary as the abrassive material was leaving marks on the doll</p>

    <p>Images from the 10th of october, Today I was working on revising the final asset, I was in zbrush and was scuplting additional details, I made use of the professional workflow from zbrush to maya to substance painter, creating a low poly model of the high resolution asset and baking in fine detail, this was as I wanted to experiment with finishes of the object and because I decided to redesign thecharachter, hollowing the charachters cheast out to further reveal that he is missing the human inside. An allegory for the current detachment from history and this new soulless individidualistic way of being that is becoming more prevalent as we continue into the digital market ecosystem.</p>

    <p>On the Sunday the 13th I went into unity with the plan to work with speed, i used a ready made resource workflow where I was downloading hundreds of different assets from online and recombining them through the work.</p>

    <p>Alongside this I developed a custom charachter controller where I can trigger various poses by pushing other letters on the keyboard, pair this with the live game view recording and I have a million times faster workflow to test angles, different animations, and to shoot and reshoot the scene. The system I have developed is more of a staging and puppetry tool than a traditional 3d rendering pipeline.</p>

    <p>This was inspired by the works of sam rolfes who I used to be obsessed with and the his digital puppetry technique that he uses within unreal engine using vr controllers and ragdoll physics to quickly iterate and bring to life in an organic way the scenes</p>

    <p>My methodolgy is quite different but this was difinitely at the back of my mind swimming around while I was developing this technique.</p>

    <h3>Today (The 13th)</h3>
    <p>I also worked inside ableton to further develop the audio maijking use of several ai tools, suno, local chattts, noise remover ( to be able to extract speech in tiktoks without the underlying music )</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WFiMcAj.png" alt="Ableton Work 1">

    <p>I found that if you make the text longer than the allocated time for the ai generation of the audio that the audio breaks, finishes mid sentence and adds odd linguistic upps, downs and additional sounds, this is self revealing, the double fake, it fits. This rapid fire testing, throwing different text excerpts in etc has been interesting.</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/S7PxKvB.png" alt="Ableton Work 2">

    <p><h1>Note directly from my journal on sunday 

    </h1>- A fake lets play game where Instead of animating all of the different walk cycles, poses etc I can achieve the animations that I want using complex sets of poses, right now I have added walk, idle and fall, walk is based on if the charachter is moving and fall is triggered when pressing F 
<br><br>
        The idea of the lake and the fish as a method for feeling in touch or having realisations about the coexstience of creatures through this world, I listened to an eye opening book in june via amazon owned audible through my apple airpods via bluetooth and wifi and yet it affected me, this double real and fake can make meaningful changes to  us. However there is a reason he does not falll into the water and remains forever in stasis not truly connecting. 
        <br><br>
        I attempted varied forms of implementing AI video creation into my worklow today, however I found they were slowing me down and it would be more effective to build a system where I can use my puppet like a puppet. A control system for set animation loops that I can customise and use to perform the video trough 3d environments and my own desing.  I utilised  audio creation tools and have created rough draft for around the first 3 minutes of the video. I can pose this as a remix and steal sounds from all over the net, maintaining a list of where I source them from - so far as I maintain a list and refrence them all. I have played with automation and downloaded some sample packs.
