    <h3>For my critical reflection I am supplying the speech I gave on the last day that I frantically wrote that morning after arriving at Yalamaya Kendra 
    </h3>

    <p>On Monday I wrote in my journal - "the rise of tourism is an imposition onto the local community and is an act of colonisation by capital." This was our 3rd day in Kawasoti; the night after DB G treated us to live dance from the real Tharu people from the area.</p>
    

    <p>This dance is representative of the commodification of the local knowledge and practices such as this. The sale of indigenous culture as an experience washed clean with responsible and sustainable practices run and owned by people who grew up in the area. This is the proposed path forward for the region by Dibi.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"We now know that in the first phase of the national struggle colonialism attempts to defuse nationalist demands by manipulating economic doctrine. At the first signs of a dispute, colonialism feigns comprehension by acknowledging with ostentatious humility that the territory is suffering from serious underdevelopment that requires major social and economic reforms."</p>
        <p><strong>- Frantz Fanon - <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em></strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This economic reform and shifts globally with large scale farming methods and a global capitalist marketplace of trade has impacted the practices of local farmers according to our host (DB G). With cheap, mass-produced goods being imported from countries such as India undermining the traditional farming practices due to costs and labour for maintenance of crops.</p>

    <p>DB proposes that the answer is to sell the traditional farming practice to tourists as a part of the experience; organic, locally farmed, real indigenous food for people like us; perfectly in time for the middle class, liberals hunger for understanding and connecting with real indigenous knowledges; and market trends towards sustainable / eco tourism. These plans are farther reaching with a planned eco corridor between community forests, the addition of a learning center about local knowledges, a cow ranch at the vulture restaurant and a training program to teach people skills in hospitality.</p>

    <p>Our conversations aimed to understand people’s views on this economic shift – not to retell or fetishise, but simply to capture opinions on the changes and their impact on people’s lives. From the start, this was our goal. As we worked, wrote questions together as a group, and engaged in conversations, these topics were always present.</p>

    <p>I&#39;d say that as a group we approached the program with skepticism. We have spoken on the limited perspectives we have gathered. Four out of the five interviewees were people who directly benefit from the work of DB. This direct facilitation and relationship with DB was beneficial given our time restrictions but completely skewed and undermined the goal of the project.</p>

    <p>The two people outside this echo chamber, Khimkumari Mahato and Jitram Mahato, highlighted the changes and impact of zoning restrictions on traditional farming practices.</p>

    <p>I didn&#39;t find the answers; <br>
    Time will tell whether via capital these traditional practices abstract and turn into a plastic duplicate of the traditional ways of being in Kawasoti; as more knowledge and practices are sold as experience through this economic shift to tourism.</p>

    <p>If this is a first for a new model of gradual economic change and if what DB was saying about how the global economy is undermining traditional farming practices due to an influx of cheaper, mass produced goods holds true.</p>

    <p>Then in my eyes this approach, when standing against shock economic reform, big business exploitation, mining, manufacturing etc., is much more elegant. <br>
    I believe none of these critiques really matter if in the end people are happy and proud.<br>
    The larger capitalist imperial machine will not stop, the only way forward is to compete on the global economy unfortunately.</p>

    <p>It is sad to see that even Kawasoti has been colonised by capital.</p>
