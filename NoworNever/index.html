                <p>Ben Frost shakes you to your core, the speaker system absorbed made the crowd assimilate to the noise. In some sense we lost autonomy. Swallowed and left to hold on. One friend who doesn't like this style of music but had FOMO was complaining saying they felt like their body and mind was abused, their ears were ringing and they felt continuos discomfort. 

                    <ul>
                        <li>Australian-born musician, composer, record producer, sound designer</li>
                        <li>based in Reykjavík, Iceland as of 2014</li>


                    </ul>

                    <p><em>In the sonic crucible of Ben Frost's Scope Neglect, music undergoes a metamorphic alchemy. From the album’s opening seconds, the familiar aural chemistry of metal is immediately untethered, isolated in the vacuum, stripped of its cultural trappings and heavy armory, and loaded into a particle accelerator.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Where Scope Neglect leans sonically into metal - fuelled by progressive metal outfit Car Bomb’s guitarist Greg Kubacki and bassist Liam Andrews of fellow Australians My Disco - its true form seems to draw more upon the transcendental reveries of the West Coast minimalists. What at first appears confrontational, and ephemeral, is meditatively and methodically unfolded through time, revealing crystalline vulnerabilities.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Frost’s titles weave narratives of cycling, perpetual attempts at ignition, math, and mythology; ‘Tritium Bath’, ‘Lamb Shift’, ‘Chimera’... The slow burn of ‘Unreal in the Eyes of the Dead’ channels the disorienting writings of author W.G Sebald, whose own work often gives the impression of being only the faint, flickering shadow of its actual referent.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Similarly, this genre-defying music seems to feed on an unseen dark matter. Detached from their native surroundings, guitar shapes roar through negative spaces whose dimension is only revealed through the shadows cast upon them. What remains is the outer scaffolding of structures long since dismantled, and which we can no longer see. What Frost wants us to hear, in other words, is frequently not what he wants us to feel. ---- from <a href="https://benfrost.bandcamp.com/album/scope-neglect">https://benfrost.bandcamp.com/album/scope-neglect</a></em></p>

<li>Originally built in 1879 during a transformation of Carlton Gardens for the 1880 Melbourne International Exhibition</li>

<li>During this time in Australia - </li>

<li><em>First Nations people in the eastern states were increasingly coming under the control of Aboriginal Protection Boards. New South Wales followed the lead of Victoria and established their own board in 1883. The boards were given powers by their parliaments to require Aboriginal people to live on reserves, seek permission to gain employment, and denied the use of language and customs. They also removed children from their parents which led to the slave labour of teenagers and introduced strict conditions around freedom of movement and visitation of families. --- source: <a href="https://myplace.edu.au/decades_timeline/decade/1880">https://myplace.edu.au/decades_timeline/decade/1880</a></em></li>

                <p>GABBER MODUS OPERANDI was accidentally founded by Kasimyn and Ican Harem following their fad staging at an underground punk concert in Denpasar. After some DJ- and MC-ing, Kasimyn began producing tracks for the duo using the smallest musical instrument: the Mini Synth Teenage Engineering OP-1, while Ican Harem provides vocals and joke-filled improvisation.

                    <br>

                    Their experimentation began with a healthy obsession for the energy and intensity of jathilan (Javanese ritualised trance-dance), gabber, dangdut koplo (Indonesian folk music), Chicago footwork, grindcore and noise music. Manipulating traditional song samples, borrowing from the rooted pentatonic scale, especially Balinese gamelan, and adding some finishing touches with their own sound design, Gabber Modus Operandi attempt to provide another bridge over the unique gap between humor and the darkness of contemporary music and tradition in Indonesia. Their exuberant digital sarcasm straddles (and questions) the line between the sacred and the banal.</p>

                <p>Alexandra Drewchin, known as Eartheater, embodies the cultural melting pot of Queens, New York. Her music is a vibrant mix of hip-hop, trap, melancholia, afrobeat, and Latinx influences. Born to a Russian father and English mother, Eartheater's multicultural background infuses her work with a unique perspective, reflecting the increasingly fluid nature of cultural boundaries in contemporary art.</p>

                <p>Thinking about simulacra and cultural simulations in the post modern ---- 
<br><br>
                    <em>"Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal."</em>

                    <ul><li>On the idea that there is no longer a cultural orgin; that the new metamorphosis of cultural identity is the hyperreal. 

                        <li>Eartheater as example; a cultural mix of Queens, Russia, America; Music pulling from, techno, dream pop, afrobeats, latino rhythems, siren singing. 
                            <li>A cultural hyperreal.</li>
