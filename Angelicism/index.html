    <h1>What is Angelicism?</h1>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>"The first difficulty with angelicism is that it has no content. Angelicism01 never posts content, since content is not its content; it formalizes contents, negatively by limiting each, affirmatively by including each. Another way of saying this is: angelicism is content w/o content. It is with with without and w/o w w. It is wow , wow , and wow ; and it is w/o w/o/w with wow.wow.wow ; and so on.</p>
        <p>If angelicism has no content—it is content instead to rove—it at least has formalizable traits. Extinction qua extinction, the last night in heaven, omnilapse together with retardation—these are just four of the postulates and axioms of angelicism."</p>

    <h2>10 HOUR DOOMSCROLL LEADING TO THE PREFIGURATION OF THE FEELING OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE ANTHROPOCENE</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>This feeling that was evoked through the piece was the smoothing of the brain back to its meme compilation true self and through this we could experience the online in a very real form.</li>
        <li>Relating to a priori and reverie;</li>
        <li>The film pushes you through countless plots and subplots, weaving a state of reverie as you decipher meaning from the flow of images and short content.</li>

    <h3>Vilem Flusser: The Technical Image</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Codified meaning and language into image through learnings of different perspectives from the internet lead to varying versions of disseminating the film.</li>
        <li>The extensive use of memetic imagery leads you to half recognize something for a split second and then to move and then be flashed with another meme and then an esoteric symbol.. the tying together of these narratives and symbols are different for each and where they spend their time on the internet</li>
    </ul>

        <h1>EVERY IMAGE EVER AS JAMES BRIDLE'S NEW AESTHETIC</h1>
        <p class="quote">"Let's look at some recent examples. Every satellite image posted is
        a meditation on the nature of mapping, which raises issues of perspective
        and power relationships, the privilege of the overhead view and the
        monopoly on technological agency that produces it."</p>

    <h1>As far as I can understand the new aesthetic is any imagery that reveals through it some of the underlying frameworks, stories, politics or structures that lie within them; through both the methods of creation, storing and distribution of these images play within context. Specifically to do with our networked infrastructure and modern interactions with the stack </h1>
