                <p>Collins Dictionary: <em>"A reverie is a state of imagining or thinking about pleasant things, as if you are dreaming."</em></p>
                <p>For me reverie is not inherently pleasant; it is a moment of awe and a connection to the light. The earth, god, reflection, clarity etc.</p>

                <p>To me Cory Arcangel's Super Mario Clouds invokes a sense of reverie. A dream like state of being of intimate reflection. Looking to the sky as the world and chaos moves on. This deep personal connection or a moment of all passing by. The stripping back to the pure moment.</p>

                <p>In <em>Ascension</em>, Bill Viola captures the ethereal transition between life and death, a moment suspended in time. The figure rises, leaving behind the physical world, drifting into an otherworldly space. The water becomes a veil between reality and the infinite. God lies here in the darkness, not struggling, not swimming, giving in and laying; feeling the currents of the world and hearing her heart beat.</p>

                <p>In <em>The Crossing</em>, Viola juxtaposes fire and water, destruction and renewal. The figure walks toward an inevitable end, consumed by flames or submerged in water, yet the piece is not about fear or loss. It's about the acceptance of these forces, the surrender to something greater; in the face of the unknown, a moment of clarity within chaos. An ascension</p>

                <p>Ed Atkins' digital beings exist in a liminal space, provoking an uncanny reverie. It's like dreaming while awake, blurring the lines between the real and the virtual. The audio within the film shifts between isolated focus on the main voice, diegetic, and abstract sound elements. The pauses, breaks and timing of the whole piece is integral to it.

                <p>The gentle shift of light entrances the mind allowing the soul to calm. A steady speed that never changes. Always well lit, you are freed to completely let go. There is no unexpected. A serene, continuous glow. This work embodies reverie as a state of surrender, of merging with the light, where time dissolves into pure experience.</p>

                <p>James was raised as a Quaker; Quakers gather in silence until moved by the spirit to speak. This quiet reflection is something Turrell uses through his work. His installations blend daylight with electric light, creating spaces that invite you to pause, reflect, and lose yourself.</p>

                <p>The in-built visualiser on the Playstation 3 uses soft light, patterning and abstract forms to show the music you are playing. While some examples respond to rapid, intense beats, when silent, it brings to mind the quiet, meditative qualities of Turrell's work. A digital reverie, where the TV becomes a gentle presence in the room, not commanding attention.</p>
                <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Play a silent song on the PS3 visualiser endlessly looping or somehow hack it for a live audio feed and use diegetic sounds from a room.</p>
                <p>The TV is on mute, it's a warm summer's day and the visuals play on the television; not taking up the space, not disturbing just peaceful.</p>

                <p>A vast digital expanse, a beautiful ecosystem of digital beings and humans. A moment that opens the viewer's imagination to the impossible. Setting the surreal limitless place where about half of the film takes place. There is a real emphasis on peace and beauty in these shots to contrast the narrative and visuals for what is about to erupt.</p>

                <p>Angelicism - Paradise cut 10 hours</p>
                <p>I realized I was watching the first film ever. The real film01; a lot of people have this format on the tip of their lips; angelicism was the first. The wandering spirals and loops the film takes are meant to lead you to these epiphany moments or of clarity and understanding sometimes I wished it would just cut to the chase though. Boring art kids in NY walking around for 40 minutes and then the punch line hits. It could've been put in a meme.</p>
                <p>There is a serene feeling as you can feel your brain becoming smoother as 10 hours of TikTok clips and YouTube videos play alongside cut filmed footage on the streets of New York. It's all about angelicism but it's also about love, love, extinction, cruelty, spite, gossip and lorecore.</p>
                <p>One of my notes was "Trying to decipher the world when all it was is beautiful". I wrote this at eight or ninth hour into the film. It struck me and I felt in that moment reverie.</p>
                <p>We are in paradise and I will choose to see it.</p>

            <h2><span class="arrow">▼</span> On Poetic Imagination and Reverie - Gaston Bachelard</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"If dream is a reminiscence, it is the reminiscence of a state preceding life, of a state of dead life, a kind of mourning before happiness. We might go one step further and put the image not only before thought, before narrative, but also before any emotion. A sort of nobility of spirit is associated with poetic fright; this nobility of the sorrowing spirit reveals a nature so primordial that it forever guarantees first place to the imagination. It is the imagination itself that thinks and that suffers. It is the imagination that acts and that is discharged into the poem. The notion of symbol is too intellectual. The notion of poetic experience is too experimental. [2] Random thought and experience are no longer sufficient to penetrate the primal imagination."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"It must be admitted that fright does not come from the object, from the scenes evoked by the narrator; fright is born and reborn ceaselessly in the subject, within the reader's soul. The narrator has not confronted his reader with a frightening situation; rather, he has put him in a fright situation. He has stirred the fundamental dynamic imagination. The writer has directly induced the nightmare of falling in the reader's soul. He rediscovers a primal sort of nausea that is related to a type of reverie deeply engraved in our inner nature."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Gaston Bachelard frames reverie as a primal, pre-cognitive state of being.</p>

            The classic work originally played with an orchestra I believe. To bring attention to the surroundings and the place in the world. 
            The piece centers the person through their silence. The world's ambient soundtrack, usually ignored, becomes the piece. 
            Reverie through absence.

        <p>
            In a way, Kant is exploring the framework that shapes our entire reality—those hidden rules that guide our perception, 
            even when we're not aware of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I think about this in the context of reverie, it's like that moment when you're lost in thought, not really bound 
            by the physical world around you. It's a space where your mind drifts into a place of pure ideas, detached from what's tangible. 
            Reverie feels like tapping into something deeper, almost like a direct line to the structures Kant talks about—the invisible 
            grid that holds everything together.

            Quite similar to James Turrell in the use of light and expected / unexpected although this plays directly to the mythos of the sun 
            and the animalistic interaction with it that exists a priori.
