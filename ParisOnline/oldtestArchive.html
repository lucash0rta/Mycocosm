      <p>​
      10:09 Wednesday 20th of July. An unknown woman shakes us awake. Me, still dressed in shirt and tie, and my partner in crime Julia, reeking of alcohol from the night before. This is not a twisted one-night-stand story, the woman’s name is Jessica and she had let us in at 4am in the morning when we found ourselves locked out on the streets after a night of chaos. Still hazy, I looked around the room and let the memories fall into place one after the other.</p>

      <p>
        The day before, we had arrived at the biggest festival in Switzerland to conduct interviews, the first stop on our journalistic pilgrimage towards the glorious French Riviera. On the hunt for the perfect story, we had been roaming the festival area. Filling our bags with beer backstage before crossing paths with the French rockstar/queer cowboy ELOI. 
      </p>

      <p>​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​10:22 Wednesday 20th of July. The fog of my memories suddently lifted with the sound of foul swearing coming from my companion. We gathered up our hats and cameras and stumbled out of Jessica's apartment. Julia lit a cigarette in the parking lot, the heat was strangely pressing and she looked at me with piercing eyes. We both knew that this trip had become a race of endurance. To write about the journey in any conventional press sense was absurd. But we are, after all, professional journalists; so we had to find story, for good or ill.</p>

      <p>15:47 Wednesday 20th of July. Note: Men at festivals dressing like flowers or not at all. All saying they look to feel comfortable and free. A meadow of men, sprung out in full bloom.</p>

      <p>10:23 Wednesday 20 of July. We spent the rest of that night rounding up material and packing our bags. Our trip was different. It was to be a gateway into our second issue and an affirmation of everything right and true about this world. But, only for those with true grit.</p>

      <p>In total control. Two good boys hitting the road to go south in a bright green Flixbus. Stoned, ripped, twisted, good people.</p>

      <p>15:21 Thursday 22 of July. Many hours later we arrived on the French Riviera. The glory days of the Yacht Club hotel where we would spend the night were clearly over. Already in despair of the situation, we listened back to our material from the festival and realized it was all terrible gibberish. Madness. It made no sense at all. See for yourself, just press play.</p>

      <p>10:23 Friday 22 of July. It was time to get grounded. To ponder this rotten assignment and figure out how to cope with it. It was time to do the job. Both of us had been up all night, we were in no mood for coffee and donuts. We wanted strong drinks. Sipping on my Blue Lagoon I couldn't help but ask myself: What were we doing? What was the meaning of this trip? Were we just roaming around in an alcohol frenzy of some kind? Or had we come to the French Riviera to write a story?</p>

      <p>T: I hate to say this but this place is getting to me. I think I’m getting the fear.</p>

      <p>J: Nonsense. We came to the French Riviera to write a story and now that we're right in the vortex you want to quit? You must realize man, we've hit the main nerve.</p>

      <p>T: That's what gives me the fear.</p>

      <p>22:41 Friday 22 of July. Here we were. No cash, no story for the magazine, left to rot on the French Riviera. Wandering aimlessly along the highway there was every reason to believe that we had been pushing our luck too far, when a sign presented itself in the dark sky. “Magic world” a flourescent </p>

      <p>10:23 Friday 22 of July. This place was madness in all directions, at any hour, it could strike sparks everywhere.I followed Julia as she moved through the arcade games and continued towards the white sign on the hill. A sense that what we were doing was right. This was our future, the place of rebirth. Watching the silhouette of her back disappear into the wilderness I thought to myself: there she goes, one of God's own prototypes. A high power mutant never considered for mass production. Too weird to live, too rare to die.</p>

      <p>This was not the end of our story, this was the very start of it. Below follows the second issue of Parisonline, the perfect trip, through space and time. Buy the ticket. Take the ride.</p>

    <h2>Adey on nudes and love letters</h2>
    <p>Text by <span style="color: #E476E4;">Tova Olsson</span>, Photography by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__adey__" target="_blank">Adey</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stom.k" target="_blank">Luka Perkins Petit</a></p>

    <p>I'm meeting the person who two days earlier asked me to take my clothes off and crawl on the white limestone cliffs of Marseille. It's nothing unusual to the British photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__adey__" target="_blank">Adey</a>, who considers clothes to be fake and has dedicated their work to portray the weird creatures hiding underneath. Having flaunted everything but their face around the world's most prestigious galleries, the anonymous artist has now arrived on the south coast of France to write a love letter and drink rosé.</p>

    <p><small style="color: #F389F3;">[Luka Perkins Petit]</small></p>

    <p style="color: #E476E4;">So, you've seen me naked... Do you think that changes how we interact now?</p>

    <p>"No, not for me. But I've seen a lot of people naked. So I don't know... Now that you bring it up I get the image of you naked in my head, which is quite funny. Maybe it makes us more connected?"</p>

    <p style="color: #E476E4;">Yeah, there is really nothing to hide haha.</p>

    <p>Adey has been looking to peel off the uncomfortable layers of life for the last 15 years, when they left London and a career of dance behind and moved to Sweden. “I was fed up with the fast life, tired of living my life to zero every month. I worked my ass off and didn’t feel appreciated.“

      In search of simplicity they started drawing stick figures, using an analogue camera and portraying naked bodies to create what they describe as images of utopia. People playing around in abandoned buildings or deep forests without a care in the world, perky buttcheeks juxtaposed with gray concrete. Photos that strike me more as cute images of what the end of the world could look like rather than of paradise. Reading from the hype for Adey, people seem to be longing for the innocentification of the world that their photos offer: playful images of a dystopian future and the naked body itself. The latter – in popular culture, so often offered to a consumer in a dark context of “sex sells” – is through Adey’s lense set free to play.</p>

      <p>Looking at your previous photos I sometimes think of Pina Bausch, maybe because of how the industrial meets the tender and romantic...

        Is that something you see in your photos?</p>

        <p>

          “Yeah I do see it. It’s not a conscious integration but when I was young and studying physical theater we went to a Pina Bausch show and I remember that my mind exploded. It was the best thing ever.” To Adey, the industrial emptiness also speaks of their personal experience of living in Scandinavia. “I do feel lonely in Sweden and I think that’s translated into my work. I don’t want to go into it too much but I’ve definitely been through times of depression in Sweden. Luckily, people have always managed to pull me out. They know I find the fun in the world around me, no matter what.”</p>

<p>To Adey, movement itself is an energetic form of love, running through every part of their life. As a way of reconnecting with that source, Adey is looking to break with the passive position of the photographer. “I’ve staged my photos to the point where I’ve become static, because of the way I was shooting and the equipment I was using. Now I want to move!” In recognising movement as their very fundament, Adey’s new project is telling the story of their personal journey, inviting their parents as models: “My new series is in some ways a love letter to dance. Knowing my parents kind of enabled that I think that they should be a part of the series. But, they are divorced so I’ll see if they’ll agree to participate haha...”</p>

<p>As even time is moving forward, Adey themselves became a parent last year: “I feel like it’s impossible to put into words what it’s like having a child before you experience it. Sitting there watching this young person discover movement is magical. Watching that everyday... Sometimes it happens secondly.”</p>

<p>As we are about to wrap up the interview Adey whips out their phone to show me a photo. “I drew this for a couple...Knowing it's not really possible. It's someone just straight up sitting on somebody's head. And then...” They swipe to the following photo. “It happened!" Adey laughs and shakes their head: “We’re such funny creatures, we’re really weird... Like what the hell is going on and why we’re still here.”</p>

<!-- Funeral of a prince -->

<div class="SectionArticle">
<h2>Funeral of a prince</h2>
<p>Text, Film and Photography by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scillaxrajalin" target="_blank">Scilla Rajalin</a></p>

<p>I am a multidisciplinary artist from Sweden, based in London. With my background in dance, choreography and composition, I am currently developing my work as a director, focusing on documentary and live performance. My current research questions where documentary methods meet live performance. To me, this means engaging with people and subjects in an informative, archiving matter, with a neutral and/or investigative agenda. This includes recognition of the instinctive, imaginative and ambiguous aspects of improvisation, art and live performance. My practice stems from local collaboration with visual artists and sound artists, working between fields of movement, physical theatre, film and creative writing. Re-occurring themes in my work include satire, nonsense, unreliable realities and systematic cycles of routines and patterns.</p>

<p>I am currently writing a script in preparation for my next live work, titled ́Funeral of a Prince ́. This work is a queer,

  pseudo-realistic, live documentary of a de-gendered non-royal prince and his journey towards becoming (and surviving as) a director. [...]</p>

<p>The work explores notions of time - and our non-linear perception of it - as well as structural patterns and habits

  (both primal and social) and what we do to dismantle them.
  
  I am interested in the psychology of characters and what happens dramaturgically when we merge the identities and perceptions of them. The script is about one person as well as many. It's a mix of autobiographical experience, imagination and full blown phsycadelic fantasy - It balances between realism and fiction as we follow the character(s) through life, from birth to potential death. The prince transcends gender and time, pronouns and expectations - a modern Orlando if you wish.
  
  My time in Marseille was essential to the project as I spent the residency finalizing the script and editing visual footage, making a short trailer in representation of the work. The prince’s experience of the city was full of surprises, food and adventure; and I got to follow him closely through it, collecting data, knowledge and references to who or what he actually is.</p>

<p>The story of the prince is brief; it fits in 11 short chapters and 3 slightly longer. It’s not the kind of story to be cut open, torn apart and divided; it’s a body, a meal, and it is to be experienced in its entirety – all according to the prince. He made me sit down and read the whole thing in one go, it was quite the effort... He says it’s not finished, he says it’s too long to publish and too important not to. I find him greedy and pretentious, and stole some notes from his diary while he was away “on some business” ... He would kill me if he knew you had them.</p>

<p>At night, tracking the streets of his new city and the patterns of people, the prince stumbles upon a church. There is a service happening. He goes there of course. The people are singing as he walks in, he doesn’t understand the lyrics, but it sounds beautiful. He sits down at the back, that way he doesn't disturb anyone with his late arrival. Plus, he can see the whole church from here. The church walls with their grand paintings, the colored glass windows and the gold painted pillars. And all the people; Some sitting, some standing up, a few of them kneeling. He is very moved by it all. The prince receives communion, it feels unfamiliar, but he remembers. The prince prays, it feels unfamiliar, but he remembers...</p>

<p>The prince buys a pizza Calzone. He has grand plans for it but all it does is give him a stomachache; you can’t have it all. He’s all alone in the outdoor seating of the restaurant, it feels very...loud. Too aware of his posture, he does his best to look cool. Fine by himself. A long line of people is queuing up next to the restaurant; there’s something happening further up the street. People look at him, but he’s used to it, used to eating alone, used to the awkwardness. The restaurant apparently doesn't have any paper menus, so when he asks about the food the waiter brings out the whole chalkboard and puts it on a bar stool right in front of the prince. It’s huge. The prince is embarrassed, but he’s used to that too. The door next to the restaurant is open, there’s a dance class going on inside. Some kind of two-person-dance, it’s quite wild. They swing violently to high tempo folk music. Fun thinks the prince. The prince used to dance as well, it feels unfamiliar, but he remembers, swaying gently in his chair. Dance might be the most important thing of all. It might also be something else.</p>

<p>Do you have to smoke in France? The prince wonders. His throat hurt from just half a cigarette, what a wimp... but it seems mandatory here, and it looks cool, so he continues holding it casually between two fingers. He’s been invited to a party by a cool guy from London, with lots of tattoos and a very chic mustache. He goes there of course. The party ends up being more of a casual dinner and it’s the best time he’s had all week. They laugh and talk and drink lots of wine. The prince feels immediately at home. The cool guy from London asks to read the prince’s future, he has cool tarot-cards, probably from London. The prince accepts the offer, and they spend a long time talking about all the wishes, needs and fears of the prince. It’s a very intimate moment. When it’s time to go, another guy offers to drive the prince home on the back of his bike, they apparently live quite close to each other. [...]</p>

<p>The prince accepts the offer and holds tightly around the guy's waist as they fly down the steep streets in the night. This too is a very intimate moment. They stop to listen to some people playing jazz in an open doorway, they drink something French and get back on the bike in a slightly wobblier manner.

  The prince goes to bed alone, undeniably aroused, relaxed and smiling like a goof. Drunk from the experience, and probably from the wine.</p>

  <p>Next day is the first day of November. The prince does not notice this in time, and it catches him by surprise.

    He ́s experiencing the tiniest of hangovers, only seen in France, just enough to wake you up hungry and anxious. Anxiety gets worse when you’re in an unfamiliar house, especially if you fear it has bedbugs. The prince goes outside hoping it will help.
    
    It does! It always helps. He goes straight up to the top, the tippidy tip top of the city, where the view is magnificent, and the air is fresh. There are lots of hills here, which is one of the prince’s favorite traits of any city, it comes with such a great opportunity to surprise you. You walk and walk, through narrow streets with high, scuffled buildings, not sure of the direction. And suddenly the street opens wide, the light pours in through the gap and you can see everything; the sea, the mountains, the hills, the streets, the buildings, the tiny people, the smoke from all the restaurants and the bedbug infested sheets hanging out of windows to dry. The city looks very French, everything here looks very French. Shouldn’t come as
    
    a surprise really.</p>

    <p>He has a key to somewhere, somewhere new and not yet visited. He goes there next. It’s a beautiful place. Fabrics hanging from nothing, nice people with strange jobs and a little kitchen to make more coffee. There’s a child there too, I forgot his name, but he likes to point his tiny red laser pen in the prince’s face. Probably to see if he will react, he doesn’t. The child smiles.

      He goes to the park, where people are fighting. Supervised fighting, practicing with long wooden sticks. It looks really cool. The prince would like to learn but the people seem really advanced already, plus, the prince wouldn’t know how to ask.</p>

      <p>Later that day, at the new apartment with 3 dead bedbugs,

        3 beers and 1 lovely boy called Luka, the light has shifted, and with it his mood. In the calmness of the afternoon, and after treating the hangover with some bread and cheese, the new bedbug-house seems less scary, less strange. It’s unfamiliar, but he knows it now. He finds an old album of French rap that he used to like, it’s still good. He sits down to write as he waits for the lovely boy called Luka to come home from work, maybe Luka wants to drink something French.</p>

<h2>Klara Keller on the road in Austin</h2>
<p>Text and Photography by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/klarakeller" target="_blank">Klara Keller</a></p>

<p>The Swedish singer went to Texas to make music and came home with a travel diary in Jack Keruac spirit. Follow Parisonline’s U.S correspondent on her journey through Austin towards her next album.</p>

<p>Part 1: Touchdown Austin, Texas</p>

<p>It was quite a journey to get to Austin, Texas, in October. I was planning to spend a month in the city to work on new music, gather fresh inspiration, and I arrived with a fresh blank slate. I had to take three flights to get there, which was unusual, since usually you only have one layover, but I had chosen a cheaper flight to save some money. I arrived in Austin at night, and the first thing that happened as I stepped out of my taxi was a woman calling my name from across the street. She turned out to be my neighbor and had been waiting for my arrival, knowing I would be getting to the house late at night. The house was a music residency I had applied to for a month of music creation. She showed me around the house and my music studio, and her welcoming attitude was so surprisingly friendly. I don't think I've ever felt so safe and warmly received, which made me realize early on that the people in this city are the most open, kind, and welcoming folks I've ever encountered. Traveling alone can make you feel vulnerable, as many of you probably know. I started my stay by going out on my own in the evenings to different places, bars, and concerts to soak in the city's vibe and get to know who was hanging out in this city. Compared to Paris, where I had to struggle to be accepted and fit in, I was now easily embraced and socially accepted by these young, open-minded Americans. I got to ride with my new friends in their cars to various concerts and Honky Tonk bars. On my third day. They say people there are stressed, busy, leading individualistic lives. In Texas, people are much more laid- back. However, a guy told me there's a significant difference between Austin and the rest of Texas. Austin is like a blue dot in the red Republican Texas. People here are open, liberal, young, and more forward-thinking than the rest of the state. What I also didn't know about Texas is that it's the second-largest state in the USA in terms of land area. If I drive 14 hours north from here, I'm still in Texas. That's why I asked the guy if Americans feel like they all live in the same country or if it's difficult to grasp, feeling like each state is its own little country. He said it feels like one and the same country despite the significant divides, and it has changed over the years.</p>

<p>Texas used to be part of Mexico, and since the state is located near the Mexican border, many people have Mexican roots, and there's a lot of Mexican influence in the culture and food. Honestly, I don't think I've eaten anything else during my three weeks here. Austin is quite clearly divided into the northern and southern parts, with a river in between. On the western side, you can go swimming in the river. Barton Springs is a pool in the green, sparkling river. Here, turtles swim, little lizards crawl, 

  hawks fly, and mosquitoes buzz around. Barton Springs is a must-visit if you come here! Texas gets incredibly hot in the summer, which people find to be a downside to Austin. I've had a paradise here in October as a Swede, but I can imagine it's unbearable during the summer months. Barton Springs is in the southwest part of the city, but it's mostly in the northeast,
  
  around East 6th, where people hang out and go out.</p>

<h2>Namasenda, where the past meets the future</h2>
<p>Text and Photography by Parisonline,</p>
<p>Graphic by Phoebe Crookes</p>

<p>Namasenda has her eyes set on the future. The Swedish hyperpop musician loves action movies, rides fast cars and has released her songs on PC music and YEAR0001, two legendary labels within the contemporary music scene. “I see no point in looking back” - so that’s exactly what Parisonline asked her to do. She drew us a timeline of the most significant events in her past and in her future, meeting at the point of the present: Ambrosia, her newly released EP. We suggest you put your headphones on, even the stream of time sounds good when Namasenda is in charge.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Moved to Stockholm, August 2015</h2>
          <p>"I moved to Stockholm specifically to work with this guy, I can't tell you who, it's a secret. We produced such good music but then we stopped working together and I stayed even though that wasn't the plan. It's an important time for me because now Stockholm is my whole life. I've always felt like it's home for me, I guess in a way that I didn't find in other cities."</p>

              <li><strong>Soundtrack:</strong> Beautiful by A. G. Cook</li>
              <li><strong>Note by N:</strong> If you listen to the song with headphones it sounds like a coin is falling. I remember walking around in Stockholm with this song and always thinking I dropped something.</li>

          <p>"My tour was very successful, to meet everyone who's taken part of my songs a year after releasing them was incredible. Even though it was quite tough psychologically and logically, my tourmanager was a crazy crazy man, but I mean it turned out well. Don't ask me which cities I played in, I have no idea. But I remember London, because it was absolutely sold out"</p>

          <p>"I'm working on a new project that I'm very excited about. I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out yet but I walk around fantasizing about it. To finish it, to start the visual process... I think and hope it's gonna be my best project so far. I'm really giving all my time and patience with it."</p>

          <h2 class="title">Signed with PC Music, November 2018</h2>
          <p>"We had a session after my friend sent a drunk DM to A. G. Cook through my phone. I didn't think it went well but I guess so since I signed with them. I was just happy to work with A. G because he's awesome, that was more the goal. Back then everything was so hopeful, but then it turned out as it did. Today I can look back with love on what Alex and I produced and the relationship I got with Hannah Diamond. But like everything around the label was a mess in all the ways you can imagine. People didn't do their job. So leaving in December last year was quite a relief."</p>

          <h2 class="title">Releasing the EP Ambrosia, October 2023</h2>
          <p>"I remeber sitting at LAX waiting on my flight back to Sweden, thinking fuck. My plan had been to write in LA but everything sounded bad. I got an epiphany that I wanted to work with Simon Hessman and sent him a text like "meet me in the studio tomorrow". Then back in Stockholm the EP started growing just like that."</p>
          <p>"When I was working on the EP I secretly sat in YEAR0001's studio and one day I was out walking in Hägersten with Woesum. We talked about my song Rosa where I refer to Ambrosia and he proposed that it should be the name of the EP. I'm so proud of it, I've been so invested in every detail. I was going through a lot of personal stuff while making it. The name, Ambrosia, is the nectar in the ancient Greek mythology that brings them immortality. For me it's about that, immortality, and mortality."</p>
