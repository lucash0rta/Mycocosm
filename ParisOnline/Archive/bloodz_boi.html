        <p>Parisoline met Bloodz Boi at the Hilton in Berlin. Bloodz Boi is the pioneer of the underground
            rap scene in Beijing, he released his debut album 365 with the Swedish label YEAR0001 and is now
            considered a legend of the cloud rap genre. It was late and dark outside, but Bloodz Boi just woke
            up: “I can’t sleep well. My days consist of trying to sleep or taking pills waiting to sleep or
            sleeping.” The chairs in the lobby were of black leather and the fireplace was fake. We ordered
            whiskey, Bloodz Boi wanted a glass of water. Then he read us a poem from the notes on his
            phone, written by him in October 2023.</p>

           <p>Why did you choose this text?</p>

           <p>Because I thought about the river. A really cold river, like Berlin. It’s not just the weather, the city
            itself gives me a river feeling.</p>

            <p>Since you write in Chinese, does it ever bother you that most European listeners don’t
                understand your lyrics?</p>

            <p>No, because they can feel what I feel. I don’t need people to tell me that I gotta stay healthy or to
                stay away from pills, people that feel me will believe that I can go through this. That I can take
                care of myself.</p>

            <p>When I was young I felt like nobody cared. I just wanted people to understand me. To listen to
                my words. So then I made music and people started to respect me. I still make music because I
                want to be understood. It’s what’s most important. That’s higher than the respect.</p>

                <p>I have been touring a lot in Australia and I remember that someone who watched my show sent
                    me a message on Instagram. He wrote me that one of my songs made him think about a memory,
                    how used to lock himself inside his house during highschool. He told me that he could even smell
                    the air of the time. That the song gave him the memory. It made me very happy. I feel so grateful
                    and so lucky.</p>

                <p>What is the core of your texts?</p>  
                
                <p>Me, I think. A lot of artists have influenced me (he rolls up his sleeve and shows a tattoo of a Dean
                    Blunt album cover) but the core is always myself. I don't write about real life, my poems are about
                    my mind. Not because I live an exciting life, I don’t. I go touring to give myself a reason to go
                    outside, because I think it’s good for my health. It’s good for me to see some people, to see my
                    friends. I love my friends.</p>

                    <p>How do you write your music?</p>

                    <p>I don't have a process and I don’t follow many rules. Sometimes I try to learn, but that’s not what I
                        really want. I try to get into people's flesh and see me. That’s my poetry, and you can write down
                        yours, it’s easy.</p>

                        <p>Late at night, I take a lot of sleeping pills. I can’t quit (rolls of his sleeve to show another tattoo,
                            showing the molecule of the substance), I have this tattoo because one day I want to. After having
                            taken them I will randomly make melodies or record when I sing. The pills make me lose my memory
                            so when I wake up the next day and check my laptop everything is totally new to me. I like that
                            feeling. I save the parts I like and never re-record them. I want to keep that emotion you know. Maybe
                            the first take is bad but bad is ...okay. Music shouldn’t be beautiful. What is beautiful? No one can
                            give it a meaning. If you have a clear heart you can say whatever you want.</p>
