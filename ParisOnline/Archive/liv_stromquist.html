<p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chez Meme Lord Liv Strömqvist</p><p style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The cartoonist <b>Liv Strömquist </b>recently published a book about astrology. We met in her hotel lobby in Marais, one morning in March. The text that follows was supposed to be a feel-good article à la women&#39;s magazine. A little coffee table text with sprinkles of astrological guidance, but it turned out another way.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Everyone loves astrology. Everyone except Liv Strömquist. Perhaps she could even be considered the only public figure who has raised a critical voice against it, for another reason than it being generally lame. Liv thinks it&#39;s potentially dangerous. In interviews about her latest book, <b>Liv Strömquist’s astrology</b>, she compares it to alcohol: moderation is key. It’s not about a newfound moralism but, as so often, Strömquist&#39;s interest in the philosopher <b>Theodor Adorno’s </b>theories. In his text <b>The Star is Down to Earth </b>he presents his take on the psychological reasons behind the craze for astrology. The bottom line: we live in the Century of the self. Astrology both answers to our insatiable interest for <i>who we are, </i>and through sober advice guides us towards our petty-bourgeois dreams. Being promoted to middle manager or having a romantic encounter etc. Adorno remarks that there is a playful irony to reading your horoscope, which offers a comic relief from the pressure of having to achieve the very same goals. Liv laughs and adds that Adorno also suggests astrology might attract masochists, i.e people who are into sexual submission. None of his ideas paint a very flattering image of our horoscope-checking society, but even so it’s not the reason for Liv’s warnings. Her concerns come from Adornos’ comparison between astrology and OCD*. He believes it sparks the same mechanisms, a way to feel in control and to channel anxiety. Fine in small doses, but can lead to compulsive behavior.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">That&#39;s probably also why astrology feels fun. You get a kick from the feeling that there might not be a catastrophe coming today, haha. But it’s both the sickness and the cure.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*Obsessive compulsive disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Liv speaks from her own experiences, there was a time when she was an astrology girl. Together with her girlfriends she ravaged around town, picking on guys by asking about their zodiac sign. When she eventually got herself a man, unclear if it was thanks to that strategy or not, she nonetheless continued to live her life aligned with stars. Until one day she decided to stop. Liv was pregnant and afraid. Not for the health of her or the baby, but whether her child would be born Aquarius or Pisces, the latter being a sensitive and demanding zodiac sign. She laughs and describes how she went “completely mental” trying to calculate the date of delivery. It had gone too far.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">Then I stopped completely, it wasn&#39;t fun anymore.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">I thought we should test if you think I have a harmful use of astrology. I got three things. One: I have the Co-star app. So I know my moon sign and my ascendant and I get daily updates. Is that a risk zone behavior?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">No, I don&#39;t think that sounds so bad. It depends on what you do with it. Does your daily updates dictate your life?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">No.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">Then it’s ok.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">Okay. Now to some heavier stuff. Two: It has happened that I’ve on a first date read our compatibility out loud.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">I don&#39;t think that sounds so bad either. It&#39;s a fun way to understand people. It qualifies as getting to know someone. On the other hand, if you would look it up before and choose not to meet because you’re not compatible, then it’s gone too far.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">T: <span class="p">Okay, here comes the last one. It’s dark. If I fall in love with someone, I get an almost obsessive thought that I have to check how compatible the person is with all my friends. Out of fear that they will fall in love with each other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">L: <span class="p">Oh no! Hahah.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">I know it&#39;s terrible.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">But that&#39;s an insecurity that always comes with the vulnerability of liking someone. That uncertainty is so hard to bear so you ask yourself &quot;Is there some way to make sure that this won&#39;t happen&quot;. That’s an example of using astrology in an anxiety-relieving, slash anxiety-enhancing way. Because you could discover, for example...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">...that they are super compatible.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><b>L: </b>Haha yeah. You should try to stop. But I recognize myself in that. You want reassurance. Some kind of sign. But I don&#39;t think it’s <i>that </i>mentally ill-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">Thanks.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">L: - <span class="p">it&#39;s quite human. Haha.</span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After showing me around the quaint hotel we take the stairs up to her room. It is not the first time Liv stays here. France was the first country to translate her books and when <b>Prince Charles&#39;s sentiment</b></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">(Les sentiments du Prince Charles) was published in 2012, she hit the charts. Since then, Liv has had reason to return several times. Although the BD culture* is huge in France, she stands out. Before the release of her last book, Elle France asked themselves: &quot;What is the reason for the Liv-mania&quot;. The answer: that her books mediate philosophical and, above all, feminist theories. Also in Sweden, she can be described as one of the left wing’s most beloved educator of the masses. Therefore, this visit to Paris is different. <i>Liv Strömquist’s Astrology </i>is a book in another direction, being less theoretical.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*Short for bande dessinée, comicstrips in french.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">I think a parallel can be drawn between how your latest book and </span>Ruben Östlunds’ <span class="p">film </span>Triangle of Sadness <span class="p">(Sans Filtres) have been received. You both got cold reviews back home in Sweden but are major hits abroad. The criticism you both got has to do with lack of analysis, Ruben because it’s too shallow and in your case because it’s simply missing. I think of you two as some kind of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">present-day Mom and Dad of Swedish culture. Could this be a sign that analysis is on decline? Or have you two already peaked popularity-wise in Sweden?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">L: <span class="p">Hahah. Erm. I have always been very loved in Sweden and have received almost every cultural award there is. I understand that it’s too much to give me yet another one.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">T: <span class="p">I think that’s pretty understanding of you. Ruben feels rather bitter about his reviews in Sweden? </span>L: <span class="p">Yes maybe. But I think people are sweet and respectful and tolerant with me. They could have been much much much more disapproving about my stuff. And feel more disappointed. I think it&#39;s strange that people haven&#39;t criticized me more. Like when I read my old books I can think it&#39;s crazy that no one reacted and stopped me, haha.</span></p>

<p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Liv says she’s aware that the book is less theoretical than its predecessors, but that she wanted to write it for the simple reason that she thought it was fun. Maybe that&#39;s also one of the reasons Liv&#39;s readers forgive her for everything - she&#39;s funny. In Sweden, Liv is one of the few feminist icons who survived Metoo. <b>Cissi Wallin</b>, <b>Linnea Claesson </b>- as canceled as male the perpetrators. Those who are still considered to have some sort of relevance have, in most cases, become very skinny and renounced their feminist identity. So perhaps the “Liv-mania” has more to do with her humor and restraint from dictating people. A success sprung from portraying female experiences rather than lecturing on how to be a good feminist.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Although, <i>Liv Strömquist&#39;s astrology </i>doesn&#39;t portray the most relatable experiences. The book is populated by a gang of bizarre celebrities that are said to represent different zodiac signs. Aries’ Jane Goodall leaves society to join a pack of chimpanzees. Aquarius’ Chistioano Ronaldo decides to buy a baby for 10 million dollars. Rather than leaving you feeling any wiser about your zodiac sign, they come across as symptoms of a society that’s completely incomprehensible.Which could be said to be the core point of Liv’s book. In the last chapter, she includes sociologist <b>Aris Komporozos’ </b>theory about <b>The financialization of life. </b>Due to our economy being built on an unpredictable stock market, we are used to risk and speculation. Therefore, we accept that Trump becomes president, that a hurricane arises or that our mood depends on the placement of Venus. Komporozos’ point is that the boom of astrology is not about wanting answers in times of uncertainty, but rather seeking models of explanation that imitates the unpredictable pattern of the stock market.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><i>Liv Strömqvists Astrology </i>has an open ending, also she refrains from giving answers. I ask her why. <b>L: </b>Because, reality is like that. Or maybe it was just because I wanted to get my joke in at the end. <b>T</b>: If there’s no point you want to make, should your book, just like astrology, be seen as an imitation of our unpredictable society?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">L<span class="p">: You could say that. Yes it is, it is a reflection of a society that’s…difficult to interpret, haha.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The joke in the end of her book is very funny, the perfect comic relief in the Century of the self. Yet another way that astrology and Liv Strömqvist seem to have the same effect on people. Liv smiles mischievously, like some kind of Mona Lisa or ironic Meme Lord. It strikes me that “Liv-mania” is not that far from OCD after all. So, be aware of your Liv Strömqvist consumption ok?</p>
